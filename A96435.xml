            <title>Abraham's humble intercession for Sodom, and the Lord's gracious concessions in answer thereunto containing sundry meditations upon Gen. XVIII. from ver. XXIII. to the end of the chapter. Wherein many things are spoken of concerning believers drawing near to God, and the efficacy of their prayers; and how they may be princes and prevailers with God, and with what boldness they may come before him, and what ground they may get of him by their prayers, and what sweet communing they have with him. With sundry other things worthy of our most serious thoughts, helping us to be more spiritual and heavenly, which may prepare us for that everlasting communion and fellowship that we hope to arrive at, and come to in a blessed state of glory by Jesus Christ.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="5">5. To ſtir up the beſt to ſee their own vileneſs, and to be very humble in drawing near to God when we pray to him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To meditate of Chriſt's being <hi>the Judge of all the Earth,</hi> and plead with him to <hi>do right</hi> as being ſuch a Judge, and to conſider what our duty is in our ſeveral places, that muſt one day ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Judge.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To beſiege and beleaguer the Throne of Grace with ſuit after ſuit, and to go away with all we can from God that is ſo ready to hear Prayer, and to go as far as ever we <hi>can</hi> or <hi>dare</hi> in asking, and to fear to provoke God then eſpecially when we pray to him, and to deſire of God that he would not be angry with us, nor with our Prayers.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To go about our ordinary Employments when we have been with God, as he allows, taking in ſuch Cautions as are duely to be obſerved.</p>

               <hi>Now what help may be afforded to theſe things by the following</hi> Treatiſe, <hi>is with the Lord to give, and with his Servants to pray for. A Childe when lifted up upon a Giants ſhoulders, may be carried for above his own ſtrength: A</hi> withered Hand <hi>may be
<pb facs="tcp:136185:4"/>ſtretched out, if Chriſt ſay the word:</hi> Weak things <hi>the Lord ſometimes chuſeth, to bring</hi> mighty things to paſs by. <hi>If</hi> the Sword of the Lord and of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon <hi>go together, what may not a little ſtrength do?

               <p>IN theſe words, to the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> we have 1. The <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> in behalf of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the reſt of the Cities that God deſtroyed with <hi>Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven.</hi> 2. Gods <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> that he gave to the ſeveral <hi>Petitions</hi> he put up to him in their behalf. 3.

               <p>In the <hi>firſt part</hi> we have 1. What <hi>Abraham</hi> did; <hi>He drew near,</hi> the Text ſayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.2. What he ſaid: and therein we have theſe things conſiderable;</p>
               <p n="1">1. His <hi>deſire</hi> that theſe ſinners might be <hi>ſpared</hi> if it were poſſible, or at leaſt the <hi>righteous</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them <hi>might not be deſtroyed with the wicked, ver.</hi> 23, 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Arguments</hi> that he uſeth to prevail with God, that the <hi>righteous</hi> and the <hi>wicked</hi> may not be alike: 1. Taken from the <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> of the act, <hi>Wilt thou alſo deſtroy the righteous with the wicked?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, This would be <hi>ſtrange,</hi> Lord, and thou wouldſt go out of thy wonted way ſo to do. The 2. is taken from the <hi>vehemency</hi> of his wiſh, that ſuch a thing may <hi>never be,</hi> which he repeats twice, <hi>That be far from thee, That be far from thee.</hi> The 3. is taken from his <hi>honour,</hi> as being <hi>Judge of all the earth,</hi> and therefore for his <hi>Name</hi> muſt needs do right: <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> ver. 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have his wiſe <hi>inſinuating</hi> himſelf into the Lord, 1.

By <hi>humbling</hi> and <hi>abaſing</hi> himſelf before the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:136185:7"/>
                  <hi>Behold, now I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, which am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> 3. By <hi>deſiring</hi> the Lord not to be <hi>angry</hi> with him, for being ſo bold with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. 4. By his <hi>undauntedneſs</hi> in his Suit, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>Behold, I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord.</hi> 5. By his <hi>modeſt requeſt,</hi> at laſt, in ſpeaking but <hi>once more;</hi> mixed with an <hi>holy fear</hi> of diſpleaſing him, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>Oh let not my Lord be angry, and I will ſpeak but this once.</hi> All this concerns the <hi>firſt part,</hi> viz. <hi>Abraham's Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>ſecond part,</hi> ſcil. <hi>Gods Anſwer,</hi> we have 1. The <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of God towards him:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he never <hi>denied</hi> him in any one of his <hi>Requeſts,</hi> but granted all, from <hi>fifty</hi> to <hi>ten:</hi> So that if there had been but <hi>ten righteous</hi> in the place, it had been ſpared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that <hi>Abraham</hi> left off <hi>petitioning,</hi> before the Lord left off <hi>granting;</hi> wherein the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>greatneſs of his grace</hi> ſhewed it ſelf. The truth is, we have done ſooner in <hi>asking,</hi> then God has in <hi>giving;</hi> our deſires are <hi>ſcant,</hi> when his heart is <hi>large;</hi> our requeſts are <hi>ſhort,</hi> when his hand is <hi>long;</hi> we might <hi>have</hi> more, could we <hi>ask</hi> more: we ſpare to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and therefore we <hi>loſe much</hi> of what we might carry away with us from ſuch a <hi>Bountiful Almner</hi> as God is.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>laſt part</hi> we have 1. Gods <hi>leaving Abraham.</hi> 2. <hi>Abraham's</hi> departing to <hi>his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:136185:7"/>place.</hi> 3. A <hi>Deſcription</hi> of Prayer, and Gods <hi>Anſwer:</hi> He <hi>communes</hi> with us, and we with Him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. &amp; 10.22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart. Draw nigh to God,</hi> viz. in prayer of Faith. <hi>He is not far from every one of us,</hi> nor we from him; <hi>for in him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17.27, 28. but then in a ſpecial manner we <hi>draw near</hi> to him, when we put up our ſuits and ſupplications to him. A Suppliant to a Prince does then <hi>draw near</hi> to him, when he makes his Addreſs, and preſents his Suit to him: A Childe <hi>draws near</hi> to his Father, when he comes to ask ſomething of him: So do we to our <hi>Soveraign Prince</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> when we bring our <hi>Petitions</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>For opening of which, let me ſhew,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it is to <hi>draw near to God</hi> when we pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In what <hi>manner</hi> we are to <hi>draw near</hi> to him, when we make requeſt to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Why</hi> we are thus to <hi>draw near</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What <hi>uſe</hi> we are to make of it.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is it to draw near to God in Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Negatively. 2. Affirmatively.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:136185:8"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Negatively.</hi> 1. It is not to <hi>draw near with our lips, when our hearts are far from him,</hi> Iſa. 29.13. or as <hi>Jeremy</hi> tells God, <hi>Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins,</hi> Jer. 12.2. <hi>The man is as his heart is, Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.7. If the heart of a man therefore be <hi>far from God</hi> in Prayer, though he be <hi>near with his mouth,</hi> he is not <hi>near God</hi> in the duty. If there be any defect in the chief Wheel of a Clock within, it will not ſtrike right: ſo if the <hi>heart</hi> be wanting, which is the chief Wheel to ſet all a going in the duty of Prayer, there will be no right ſtroke given; there's no <hi>drawing near</hi> to God, when the <hi>heart</hi> is gone: there muſt be ſomething <hi>within,</hi> elſe the duty of Prayer is but a dumb idol.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not to <hi>draw near with multitude of words,</hi> as if God made any account of them; he cares not for being loaden with words: they ſhould be <hi>few</hi> when we pray to him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7. We may be far from God, when we pour out moſt words before him. This is not to <hi>draw near</hi> to God, when we word it with him. Wiſe men will have us ſpeak in way of ſuit to them in a <hi>few words;</hi> ſo the wiſe God. Some Princes have thrown away <hi>long Petitions;</hi> and God as little regards <hi>length of Prayers,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be ſomething elſe joyned with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not to come with <hi>loud expreſſions</hi> when
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:136185:8"/>we pray before him. Loud crying in the ears of God, is not to <hi>draw near to God:</hi> They are <hi>nearer God,</hi> that ſilently whiſper in his ears, and tell him what they <hi>want,</hi> and what they would <hi>have of him.</hi> They have the Kings ear, not that <hi>call loudeſt,</hi> but thoſe that <hi>ſpeak ſoftly</hi> to him, as thoſe of the Council and Bed-chamber do: So they are <hi>neareſt God,</hi> and have his ear moſt, that <hi>ſpeak ſoftly</hi> to him in Prayer. Loud cries of Beggars are not heard of men; no more are they <hi>regarded of God,</hi> Iſa. 1.15. A man will ſay ſometimes, <hi>I ſhould have heard thee, if thou hadſt not ſpoken ſo loud:</hi> what may God then ſay to loud ſpeaking hypocrites?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is not to <hi>ſpeak mournfully</hi> in the ears of God; there are thoſe that are <hi>far from God</hi> that do ſo. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. the Prophet ſpeaks of thoſe that <hi>howled upon their beds, when they cried not to the Lord with their hearts.</hi> They may be <hi>far from God</hi> that mourn in his ears, as if they were <hi>near</hi> to him. Some are like Stage-players that act the part of <hi>Mourners,</hi> onely when they are before the Lord: theſe he looks not at as ſuch as <hi>draw near to him.</hi> Even hypocrites may <hi>roar as Bears, and mourn ſore as Doves,</hi> Iſa. 59.11. Every mournful Ditty is not good Muſick with men; nor beaſt-like roaring, Melody in the ears of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not to <hi>ſeek him when he does afflict them,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:136185:9"/>Iſa. 26.16. this is to <hi>flatter him with their lips,</hi> rather then to <hi>draw near to him,</hi> Pſal. 78.34, 35, 36. A Slave that cares not to come near to his Maſter when he is buffetted and beaten, will fall down before him: A Dog when he is cudgelled will crouch before him that ſmites him. It is a <hi>forced drawing near</hi> to God, when his hand is lifted up againſt them; when the Rod and Staff is taken up, then to bow and bend onely, is that that the worſt of men will come up to: as we ſee in <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not to <hi>pray to him when it is too late,</hi> to ſeek to him when the date is out. <hi>Many ſhall ſeek to enter in,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, (when they come too late) <hi>and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luke 13.24. The <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> loſt their time, and came too late when <hi>the door was ſhut,</hi> Mat. 25.10, 11, 12. They do not <hi>draw near to God</hi> that miſs the ſeaſon, that ſlip the opportunity of coming before him. There is a time when he <hi>may be found,</hi> Iſa. 55.6. and a time when he <hi>will not be found;</hi> there is a time when he is <hi>nigh,</hi> and we may <hi>draw nigh</hi> to him, <hi>ibid.</hi> and there is a time when he is <hi>far off,</hi> and when we <hi>cannot draw near</hi> to him. They that obſerve not their <hi>time,</hi> loſe their <hi>market</hi> among men; and ſo do they that ſlack their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, loſe this bleſſed market of trading with God, and drawing near to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Affirmatively.</hi> To <hi>draw near to God,</hi> is,</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:136185:9"/>
                  <p n="1">1. To come <hi>in faith</hi> when we pray to him, for that is it that brings us <hi>near</hi> to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. This brings us into the Kings Preſence, and lets us have his ear and heart too: <hi>The King hath brought me into his Chambers,</hi> ſayes the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. But how? by the <hi>foot of faith</hi> coming to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. This is the <hi>Eye</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we look upon him, and take our full views of him, and <hi>ſee his beauty,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. If ever we <hi>draw near to God,</hi> it is by <hi>Faith,</hi> it uſhers us and our prayers into his ſweet preſence. When <hi>faith</hi> is moſt upon the wing in prayer, then we are ever neareſt God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>draw near to God,</hi> is to come in <hi>the Name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to ask what we pray for, <hi>for his ſake.</hi> Heb. 7.19. <hi>The law made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, whereby we draw nigh to God;</hi> that <hi>better hope</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt: All our Spiritual Sacrifices muſt be offered upon <hi>this golden Altar;</hi> all our Prayers muſt be put up in <hi>his Name. By him</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually,</hi> Heb. 13.15. He it is that hath the <hi>golden Cenſer,</hi> and with <hi>his much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe offers it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar which is before the Throne,</hi> Revel. 8.3. It is by his mediation and interceſſion that our Prayers come before God, and are accepted. They come to be <hi>ſweet odours</hi> by his <hi>incenſe,</hi> v. 4.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:136185:10"/>and <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8. This is to <hi>draw near to God,</hi> to come in Chriſts Name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To <hi>draw near to God</hi> in Prayer, is to come before him <hi>conſcious of our own unworthineſs</hi> to ſue to him for any thing that we ſtand in need of, either for our ſelves or others. They that are Suppliants to Princes, acknowledge their <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs</hi> to come into their Preſence, and to put up any <hi>Requeſt</hi> to them. The <hi>Centurion</hi> thought himſelf not worthy to come to Chriſt, as well as that he ſhould come <hi>under his roof,</hi> Luke 7.6, 7. and who drew nearer Chriſt then he? They that <hi>ſee their unworthineſs</hi> to come to pray to God, they of all others <hi>draw neareſt to him</hi> when they pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To <hi>draw near to God</hi> in Prayer, is to come before him <hi>ſenſible of thoſe ſins</hi> that we bring into his preſence: <hi>Behold, we are before thee in our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> ſayes that holy man, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.15. Such as do <hi>indeed draw near to God,</hi> ſee their perſons <hi>polluted,</hi> their prayers <hi>defiled,</hi> and <hi>both</hi> to need <hi>waſhing in a fountain open for ſin and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. As we are <hi>duſt</hi> in our original, ſo we gather duſt and ſoil daily, and our <hi>beſt duties</hi> are rolled in duſt, our <hi>prayers</hi> full of corruption, and ſullied all over with this duſt and mire; and every gracious heart ſees it, when he <hi>draws neareſt</hi> to the Holy One. Blackneſs and deformity is <hi>ſeen moſt</hi> before the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:136185:10"/>greateſt <hi>beauty:</hi> So when we are neareſt the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs</hi> that is in God, then our black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deformity is moſt ſeen by us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To <hi>draw near to God</hi> in Prayer, is to come before him as <hi>eying his All-ſufficiency</hi> to do all we come to ask of him, and more too: <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. <hi>To him that is able to do exceeding abundantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that we can ask or think,</hi> ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. It were a great thing to have <hi>all we ask,</hi> but much more to have <hi>all we think;</hi> but to have <hi>above both</hi> our <hi>asking</hi> and <hi>thinking,</hi> and to have <hi>exceeding abundantly</hi> above theſe, what an All-ſufficient God do we come before when we pray to him? And truely, they that do <hi>draw near to him</hi> will <hi>eye him thus,</hi> that he can do every thing, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2. that there's nothing <hi>too hard</hi> for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.17, 27. That if a King on Earth can give a <hi>City</hi> to him that asked but a <hi>peny,</hi> Oh! what cannot the Royal Majeſty of Heaven give!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To <hi>draw near to God</hi> in Prayer, is to come before him as <hi>eying his Willingneſs</hi> to grant, as well as his <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> and Power to yield to our deſires. Pſal. 145.19. <hi>He will fulfil the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of them that fear him: he alſo will hear their cry, and will ſave them.</hi> The Leper here fell ſhort; he believed his <hi>power,</hi> but doubted of his <hi>will, Mat.</hi> 8.2. but Chriſt told him of his <hi>will,</hi> as well as his <hi>power,</hi> ver. 3. And indeed this is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:136185:11"/>an happy thing, to ſee that there is a <hi>will</hi> in God to give, as well as <hi>power,</hi> for this gives God the glory of his Grace. A Kings grace lies in his Will, and ſo does Gods.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>In what manner are we to draw near to God in Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In <hi>ſincerity,</hi> with a true heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart.</hi> Truth is the Chriſtian Souldiers girdle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14. and girds up the heart, and keeps us up cloſe to the duty, that our affections do not dangle and hang looſe in Prayer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Hear my prayer, O God, that goeth not out of fained lips:</hi> He would be <hi>ſincere</hi> when he drew near to God in Prayer. It's no time to be <hi>falſe</hi> with God, when we come to pray before him. No Prince on Earth would endure a glozing falſe Suiter; how much leſs will God endure a <hi>falſe heart</hi> when we come to ſue to him? Hypocriſie is loathſome at all times, but moſt of all when we come to pray before the Lord. It's the <hi>Worm in the gourd</hi> that eats up the duty: it's the <hi>Rottenneſs of the Core</hi> that conſumes the fruit of all that we expect to come in by our Prayers: it's the <hi>Moth</hi> that corrupts the heart, and ſpoils the Petition; the <hi>Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller,</hi> and <hi>Palmer-worm,</hi> and <hi>Canker-worm</hi> that devours all before it. We muſt be true at <hi>all times,</hi> much more when we fall upon our knees and pray before the Lord.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:136185:11"/>
                  <p n="2">2. In <hi>purity,</hi> with cleanſed hands and purified <hi>hearts.</hi> Jam. 4.8. <hi>draw near to God:</hi> but how? <hi>cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts ye double-minded.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with clean water.</hi> Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in outward and inward man, is required of thoſe that <hi>draw near to God.</hi> As <hi>Holineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Gods houſe for ever,</hi> Pſal. 93.5. ſo it does become the heart of man for ever, eſpecially in time of Prayer. <hi>Alſo my prayer is pure,</hi> ſayes <hi>Job, Job</hi> 16.17. A pure heart makes a pure prayer: A pure veſſel makes the liquor pure; ſo does the veſſel of the heart if pure, make that we pour out before the Lord pure alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In <hi>humility:</hi> Humble ones draw <hi>neareſt</hi> unto God, for he is ever <hi>nigheſt</hi> unto them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. he <hi>dwells</hi> with them. This is <hi>that</hi> that we have Precept and Example for, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. <hi>If my people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall humble themſelves, and pray,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8, 9. They that <hi>draw near to God</hi> muſt <hi>be afflicted, and mourn.</hi> How humble was holy <hi>Agur,</hi> Prov. 30.2. how humble was the <hi>Publican</hi> in Prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. how humble was the <hi>Prodigal, I am not worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> Luke 15.21. An humble heart in Prayer is <hi>Gods delight,</hi> and will act any thing: he will never ſend theſe poor ones away empty.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:136185:12"/>
                  <p n="4">4. In <hi>zeal</hi> and fervency: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> This Sacrifice muſt be offered up with fire of the Spirits kindling, not of our own: it muſt not be <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> as <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1. but holy fire.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Importunately:</hi> Luke 18.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So <hi>Luke</hi> 11.5, 6, 7, 8. the Parable of the <hi>unjuſt Judge</hi> and <hi>poor widow,</hi> and the hiſtory of him that came to borrow <hi>three Loaves,</hi> hold it out that we ſhould draw near with <hi>holy importunity,</hi> and <hi>impudency,</hi> as the Greek word ſignifies, reſolving to have no <hi>nay.</hi> So the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> how <hi>importunate</hi> was ſhe; ſhe would not give out, though repulſed often, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. Some ſuiters will have no <hi>nay,</hi> ſome beggars will take no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall:</hi> ſo here, Ambaſſadors will not be gone, till they have done what they came about. Now <hi>Prayers</hi> are the Souls Ambaſſadors, that are ſent to <hi>Heaven</hi> to negotiate great things with God for us, and they will do what they are ſent about. How <hi>impudent,</hi> in an holy wiſe, was <hi>Jacob,</hi> that ſaid, <hi>I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me,</hi> Gen. 32.26.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Joyfully:</hi> Praying <hi>with joy,</hi> Phil. 1.4. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> made many Prayers, that were turned into <hi>joyful Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> ere he had done. Trace the <hi>Book of Pſalms,</hi> and you ſhall finde
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:136185:12"/>many Prayers by a <hi>Divine Chymiſtry</hi> turned into <hi>joyful Praiſes.</hi> Thoſe Prayers that are made in <hi>faith,</hi> have ever <hi>joy</hi> mixed with them. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> are <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> and therefore do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually argue one another: had we more Faith, we ſhould make more joyful Prayers then we do.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Feelingly,</hi> and from the heart: our prayers muſt be hearty prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.58. <hi>&amp;</hi> 145. They that uſe their <hi>lips,</hi> and have <hi>wandring hearts,</hi> do not pray in a right manner: God loves no complemental Suiters, but would have the heart given to him; as other wayes, ſo when we pray to him. There are ſome <hi>eloquent beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,</hi> that will flouriſh with Rhetorical ſtrains in begging, theſe ſpeak not <hi>feelingly,</hi> and from the heart, and no wiſe men will regard ſuch: ſo do ſuch as pray not with the heart, but flouriſh it with high ſtrains of ſpeech before the Lord. We muſt pray <hi>feelingly:</hi> heart-prayers are they that God looks for, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. That man is not ſerious with God in ſuch a ſerious work as Prayer is, that leaves his heart <hi>behinde him,</hi> when he comes to preſent his Suits before him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Conſtantly:</hi> Rom. 12.12. <hi>Continuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in prayer. Luke</hi> 18.1. Chriſt <hi>ſpake a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to the intent that men ſhould pray alwayes, and not faint.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.17. <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi> The woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as ſhe was <hi>importunate,</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:136185:13"/>ſo ſhe was <hi>conſtant</hi> in Prayer, ſhe held out to the laſt; ſo <hi>Jacob. Conſtancy,</hi> as it <hi>crowns</hi> all other Duties, ſo in a ſpecial manner this of Prayer. Prayer is an holy wreſtling, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. with <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. <hi>Strive,</hi> or <hi>wreſtle together with me in your prayers for me:</hi> now if a Wreſtler ſhould faint, and give out before the victory, he would loſe the Crown; ſo if we hold not out in Prayer, both our labour is in vain, and another will take the Crown from us.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Why are we thus to draw near in Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. From God. 2. From our ſelves. 3. From the Duty it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From God:</hi> 1. He hath <hi>commanded us</hi> to draw near to him, he hath given out his <hi>Royal Edict</hi> for it; and when Kings and Princes give out their Royal Edicts, all obey: ſo here, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. The <hi>Rechabites</hi> obeyed their father in his Commands, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.6. how much more ſhould we obey our Father in this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to <hi>draw near to us,</hi> Jam. 4.8. and who would not have God to draw near to him? His Fellowſhip is the <hi>beſt Fellowſhip</hi> in the world; there's all in <hi>his Communion,</hi> that is in <hi>Father, Friend, Brother, Husband, Lover,</hi> and what elſe you will, and ten thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more, and this may well prevail with us.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:136185:13"/>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath left us <hi>Examples</hi> in his Word to <hi>imitate,</hi> of ſundry that have thus <hi>drawn near</hi> to him; as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and many others, whoſe faith we are to follow, and whom to <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> will be our Crown and Glory. To be beſet with ſuch Pearls, and follow ſuch peerleſs ones, will be a glorious Diadem to our head.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>denounceth woe</hi> to ſuch as do it not: <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted:</hi> Why, what's the matter? Among other things, this is one thing complained of, <hi>ſhe drew not near to her God.</hi> See alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. Nothing is more loathſome in a wife, then <hi>not to come near her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> and nothing more abominable to God, then for his Spouſe <hi>not to draw near to him;</hi> he looks at ſuch as <hi>polluted ones,</hi> and as ſuch as are <hi>turned aſide to ſome adulterous lovers.</hi> Their hearts are gone from him, that draw not near to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From our ſelves:</hi> 1. We are never <hi>better,</hi> then when we are neareſt God, and when we have moſt communion with him in this Duty: we are in a corner of Heaven, when God and we are in a corner together; as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid at Chriſts Transfiguration, <hi>Maſter, it is good for us to be here,</hi> Mat. 17.4. ſo we may ſay when we are near God, <hi>It is good to be here,</hi> be the place what it will be: Gods Preſence makes any place a Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are never <hi>more honoured,</hi> then when we draw near to him. It is an honour to a man to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:136185:14"/>be admitted into the Kings Preſence at any time, but to be very near him, and often with him, is great honour: what is it then to be near God? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> this is greateſt honour indeed. See for illuſtration 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are never nearer <hi>comfort,</hi> then when we are neareſt God in this Duty. He is <hi>the God of all comfort,</hi> and therefore when we are near him, we are near comfort, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. What glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beams of <hi>comfort</hi> have been darted into many ſouls, when they have been darting up their Prayers to heaven, and have been ſerious with God in the duty? <hi>Heaven</hi> hath been as it were <hi>opened to them.</hi> If ever <hi>comfort</hi> meet us, it is when God and we have been together, when he hath met with us, and we with him in Prayer. As <hi>Moſes face ſhone</hi> when he had been with God; ſo our faces ſhine moſt with <hi>comfort</hi> when we have been with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.29, 30. As the <hi>Nobles of Iſrael,</hi> by being with God, <hi>ſaw him, and did eat and drink;</hi> that is, were filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as if they had been at a feaſt or banquet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.11. ſo when we are <hi>near God in this duty,</hi> it is as a banquet of wine to us,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We finde God very <hi>tender to us,</hi> and paſſing by failings, and making the beſt of what we do. There will be <hi>wandring thoughts,</hi> that like <hi>Fowls</hi> will fly upon our Spiritual Sacrifices; but if we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:136185:14"/>endeavour to <hi>drive them away,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did thoſe fowls, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.11. God will <hi>accept</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for Chriſts ſake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. though there be ſomething in the Prayer that hath not been well done, yet if God paſs by the failing, and ſay, <hi>It is well done,</hi> who ſhould finde fault with him? if he be <hi>tender</hi> to us, who can charge him? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a ſtory of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, that coming to bring a cup of Wine to him, it ſo fell out that he ſtumbled and fell, and threw down the glaſs, and ſpilt the Wine, and ſprinkled ſome of it upon the Kings garments: the King looked angerly upon him, and asked him, <hi>If he had done well in what he did?</hi> the man anſwered, <hi>If your Majeſty think it well done, it is well done. Sayeſt thou ſo,</hi> ſayes the King, <hi>then I I ſay it is well done;</hi> and ſo pardoned him. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it thus: When we are ſerving God in Prayer, ſomething comes in that marres and ſpills the Duty, but if God will paſs by the ſlip, and ſay, <hi>It is well done,</hi> and accept of it, who hath any thing to ſay againſt him? And thus of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace he does, when we would <hi>draw near to him,</hi> and do him <hi>better ſervice,</hi> he knows how to leave the worſt, and take the beſt of our deſire, and to make the beſt of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſhall finde our <hi>drawing near</hi> to God in this Duty, a <hi>Pledge</hi> of our <hi>everlaſting communion</hi> with him in another world. Communion with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:136185:15"/>God is <hi>Heaven begun,</hi> and it will never ceaſe till it fall into Eternity, as the Rivers do into the Sea. It is true, our Communion with God is <hi>little here,</hi> for what's a little River to the Sea? we are but <hi>now and then,</hi> and but <hi>ſometimes,</hi> and but a <hi>little</hi> ſerious with him; ſome acquaintance we have, but not much: but there is a time a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when <hi>we ſhall ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.17. when we ſhall <hi>ſee his face,</hi> Rev. 22.4. and <hi>be with him where he is,</hi> Joh. 14.3. &amp; 17.24. and <hi>be like to him, and ſee him as he is.</hi> And this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happy Communion follows upon our <hi>drawing near to God</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſhall finde, that when we draw near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unto God we have <hi>moſt his Image upon us:</hi> for ſo it is in <hi>Glory,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>We ſhall be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is;</hi> and ſo it is in <hi>Grace,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. Look as <hi>Moſes,</hi> by being with God, brought ſome of <hi>Heavens beauty</hi> down with him, not onely in his <hi>face,</hi> but alſo in his <hi>heart,</hi> ſome of the <hi>bowels of God</hi> toward a ſinning people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.31, 32. ſo it is with thoſe that draw near to God in Prayer, the <hi>Image of God</hi> looks freſh upon them; it is to be ſeen who they have been with, their <hi>Fathers face</hi> is ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly beheld in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Duty it ſelf:</hi> 1. It is that that Chriſt Jeſus <hi>often exerciſed</hi> himſelf in, eſpecially upon <hi>weighty occaſions;</hi> yea ſometimes ſpent the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:136185:15"/>
                     <hi>whole night</hi> in Prayer to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. and we need not be aſhamed to follow him. Souldiers follow their Leader, Sheep the Shepherds: ſo here, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27. <hi>They follow me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is <hi>that</hi> whereby we become <hi>Princes with God,</hi> Gen. 32.28. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4. and who would not <hi>prevail with God,</hi> though he get <hi>an halting</hi> by it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is <hi>that</hi> that makes us <hi>prevail with men, Gen.</hi> 32.28. If we can but be <hi>Princes with God,</hi> men ſhall never be too hard for us: <hi>Impotency</hi> ſhall not overcome, where <hi>Omnipotency</hi> yields.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is <hi>that duty</hi> that gains <hi>great things</hi> for us. What is it that may not be obtained by Prayer of Faith? it's a <hi>Key</hi> that opens <hi>all doors;</hi> the <hi>door of Heaven,</hi> Jam. 3.17, 18. the <hi>doors of the Sea,</hi> Exod. 14. Neh. 9. the <hi>doors of the barren womb,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. What <hi>Treaſures</hi> are there that Prayer cannot come at, fetch away, and bring in its hand to us?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is <hi>that</hi> that <hi>God delights in,</hi> Cant. 2.14. Prov. 15.8. it is a kinde of <hi>harmony,</hi> and <hi>muſick,</hi> and <hi>melody</hi> in his ears. Other fathers love to ſee their children <hi>playing,</hi> but our Father loves to ſee his children <hi>praying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is <hi>that</hi> that we <hi>begin our ſpiritual life</hi> with, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and muſt not ceaſe with us till we come to glory.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is <hi>that</hi> that will <hi>iſſue in praiſes</hi> in another world: our <hi>Requeſts now,</hi> will be <hi>Songs then.</hi>

We ſee what <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> God puts upon Believers when they pray to him, <hi>They draw near to him.</hi> It is great honour to draw near to a Princes Throne, to put up a Petition now and then, and to <hi>ſtand</hi> or <hi>kneel</hi> in his Preſence: Oh what <hi>honour</hi> then is it to <hi>araw near to God,</hi> and to come to his Throne to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Supplications before Him who is <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</hi> all are not ſo <hi>digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> it is the priviledge of <hi>Believers</hi> onely, they are <hi>they</hi> that have this Kings ear and heart, they may come without <hi>check</hi> or <hi>controll;</hi> it's their honour to be in his Preſence, there's no Law to inhibite them from coming, as was ſometimes in the great <hi>Perſian Monarchs Kingdome,</hi> Eſth. 4.11. they may come <hi>when they will,</hi> and as <hi>often as they will,</hi> this King hath an <hi>ear open,</hi> and an <hi>hand ready</hi> to receive their Petitions that they preſent to him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14, 15. When they come <hi>moſt frequently,</hi> they are welcome <hi>moſt cordially;</hi> when they <hi>draw near,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here, they have the honour to <hi>kiſs the Kings Hand,</hi> and to come at any time into the Preſence-Chamber without reproof. <hi>Such honour have all his Saints,</hi> and ſo it is with every one that this King <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that Believers are <hi>Favourites</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> of God, that they <hi>draw near</hi> to God. <hi>Abraham</hi> is thrice in Scripture called <hi>the Friend
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:136185:16"/>of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23. and when any thing is <hi>often</hi> ſpoken of, God would have us <hi>minde that.</hi> The truth is, none are ſuch friends of God as Believers; nay, <hi>none</hi> are friends but <hi>they:</hi> To <hi>them</hi> this King holds out the <hi>golden Scepter</hi> of his Grace. There are ſome that are ſaid to be <hi>near the King,</hi> Jer. 52.25. and of <hi>Zabud,</hi> that he was <hi>King Solomons friend,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.5. Oh but how <hi>near</hi> are Believers to God, what <hi>friends</hi> are they to him, that may come with their Petitions to him at any time without repulſe? No Favourites of Princes have more liberty then <hi>they have,</hi> to come into the Preſence of the <hi>greateſt Majeſty of Heaven. Julius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had their <hi>Favourites,</hi> and ſo had <hi>Tiberius</hi> his <hi>Sejanus,</hi> that he did call <hi>Friend,</hi> and would write to him <hi>pro amicitia,</hi> out of the friendſhip that he bore to him: but none like <hi>Believers</hi> for friendſhip and favour with God, that can come with ſuch <hi>boldneſs to his Throne of Grace,</hi> and <hi>draw near</hi> when they pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that God <hi>humbleth himſelf</hi> above all other Princes in the world, that will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to admit ſuch as we be into his Preſence, and to come ſo near him. It's great <hi>humility</hi> in the great God, to <hi>behold things that are done in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> to have reſpect to the ſervice that <hi>Angels</hi> bring before him; but for him to <hi>behold things

                  <p n="4">4.

Nature puts us far from God, as Eaſt and Weſt are in their diſtances one from another; as ſoon may <hi>Arctick</hi> and <hi>Antarctick Poles</hi> meet, as God and Nature meet together. <hi>Adam</hi> when fallen would never have come at God, but <hi>hid himſelf</hi> for ever, if God had not ſought him and found him out: So it is with all <hi>Adams</hi> Sons, they would ſhrowd themſelves any where, rather then come where God is. Of all ſuch men it is ſaid, <hi>They call not upon God,</hi> Pſal. 14.4. it is from that which is <hi>ſupernatural</hi> that we <hi>draw near</hi> to him.

He is the great <hi>Favourite of Heaven,</hi> that brings us all into favour, and brings us <hi>near God,</hi> if ever we get near to him. Favourites of Princes bring others into their Preſence: ſo does <hi>he</hi> bring us into the Preſence of God, and makes us and all our Prayers <hi>acceptable,</hi> Eph. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.15. Oh what a price ſhould we ſet upon him!

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Righteous themſelves:</hi> 1. They are a <hi>curb</hi> and <hi>reſtraint</hi> to them; at leaſt they are not ſo <hi>vile</hi> while they look on, though ſome be very <hi>impudent</hi> even in the company of godly ones, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were, 2 Pet. 2.7, 8. but or dinarily they are a <hi>reſtraint</hi> to them: they are as <hi>bit and bridle</hi> to ſuch <hi>head-ſtrong beaſts,</hi> that they dare not fly out, and break away into ſuch <hi>vile abominations</hi> as otherwiſe their corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would carry them to.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They do <hi>condemn</hi> them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. Their <hi>good example</hi> condemns them both in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences here, and will <hi>aggravate</hi> their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion another day, in that living where ſuch <hi>godly ones were,</hi> they would not <hi>learn Righteouſneſs,</hi> but be as <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>lewd,</hi> as if they had none to teach them better.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They keep off <hi>many plagues</hi> and <hi>judgements</hi> from them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22. <hi>Job</hi> 22.30. Their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:136185:23"/>their <hi>prayers,</hi> their <hi>tears</hi> and <hi>mournful ſighs,</hi> defer the coming of that <hi>Evil</hi> that the ſins of thoſe wicked ones <hi>call for:</hi> They <hi>ſtand in the gap,</hi> and <hi>make up the hedge</hi> to keep out wrath from breaking in upon them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They bring in <hi>many bleſſings</hi> and <hi>mercies</hi> to thoſe they live among, which they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have had, had it not been for the godly that have lived among them: many a fair <hi>outward bleſſing</hi> the wicked may thank the godly for, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Slaves</hi> fare the better for the abundance that is provided for <hi>Sons;</hi> yea, <hi>Dogs</hi> fill their bellies of that which is the portion of <hi>Children.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Wicked:</hi> 1. Even among them there may be <hi>ſome</hi> that God may ſhew favour to, and may effectually call home. That man runs far, that God cannot bring back again; as we ſee in perſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> Acts 9. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> Luke 19. the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Joh. 4. And righteous men living among theſe, are a means of their ſpiritual good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are ſome of them <hi>inſtrumental</hi> to bring ſome godly men amongſt them, though not out of any love to them for their godlineſs ſake. This may be <hi>bleſſed</hi> for the ſpiritual good of ſome of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are often <hi>convinced</hi> that they do <hi>naughtily,</hi> having ſuch to teach them better, both by <hi>precept</hi> and <hi>example:</hi> Their <hi>Conſciences</hi> tell
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:136185:24"/>them they do evil, their <hi>hearts</hi> upbraid them for their wickedneſs, that having ſuch <hi>lights</hi> to ſhine to them, they yet walk on in <hi>darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They do even wiſh they may <hi>die their deaths,</hi> though they know not how to <hi>live their lives, Numb.</hi> 23.10. Oh that I might die <hi>that</hi> mans death, ſayes ſuch a man, I would never deſire to fare better then he: Oh that I might fare as well, and then it would be well with me. Theſe <hi>wiſhings</hi> and <hi>wouldings</hi> they ſometimes have, by righteous mens being among them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They do ſee ſome kinde of <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>luſtre</hi> in their way, and ſpeak of the Saints <hi>happy condition</hi> very affectionately, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there's <hi>no people in the world like them,</hi> and ſpecially that <hi>God is among them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They do foretell the <hi>Saints victory</hi> over their enemies, and that they ſhall do <hi>validntly</hi> againſt all that riſe up againſt them, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.8, 9</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They learn at leaſt <hi>a form of godlineſs</hi> of them, though they cannot come up to <hi>the power</hi> of it; they learn to <hi>ſpeak as they ſpeak,</hi> and get <hi>their phraſes,</hi> and can tell how to uſe their <hi>tongues,</hi> as if they were better men then indeed they are. This they have by the <hi>Saints company</hi> which are amongſt them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They ſee the <hi>miſchief that befalls them,</hi> when they that are godly are taken <hi>from them,</hi> and what fools they were that made no better

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We ſee that as long as there are <hi>ſome Righteous</hi> ones among the wicked, we may hope that God will not deſtroy them, that he will not <hi>bury his Jewels</hi> among ſuch <hi>dunghills;</hi> that he will not <hi>burn up his Wheat</hi> with <hi>the Chaff;</hi> that he will <hi>ſpare the Wicked</hi> for the <hi>ſake of the Righteous</hi> that are among them. But I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more fully to that upon the following words. God will do much for <hi>evil men,</hi> out of reſpect to his <hi>gracious Saints;</hi> their very <hi>preſence</hi> holds <hi>Gods hands,</hi> their <hi>prayers</hi> hold his <hi>heart</hi> towards them: their <hi>tears</hi> and <hi>ſighs</hi> are prevailing arguments to keep off <hi>blows,</hi> to continue <hi>bleſſings.</hi> But enough at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Our Churches carry a fair face of

                     <hi>Purity,</hi> and they are called <hi>Golden Candleſticks,</hi> the denomination being given from the <hi>better part,</hi> Rev. 2.1. but God knows we are more <hi>droſs</hi> then <hi>gold,</hi> and little do we know what <hi>rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs</hi> lies at many hearts: if our <hi>inſides</hi> were turned <hi>outward,</hi> Oh what abominations would appear! Many a <hi>comely face</hi> we may ſee, and many a <hi>goodly ſemblance,</hi> but what <hi>Truth</hi> there is in many, <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Conſciences</hi> know, and will diſcover in due time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee what <hi>longing deſires</hi> we ſhould have for <hi>Heaven,</hi> where there will be <hi>all Righteous ones:</hi> for here <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> are mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; a few <hi>Pearls</hi> among a multitude of <hi>pebles;</hi> here and there a <hi>Diamond,</hi> among a number of <hi>baſer ſtones,</hi> one <hi>rare one,</hi> among a thouſand of the <hi>common ſort:</hi> but in Heaven they are all <hi>choice Jewels,</hi> all <hi>Righteous,</hi> all <hi>holy,</hi> all <hi>precious</hi> as the gold of <hi>Ophir;</hi> there is no <hi>mixture</hi> there, none enter there that are <hi>defiled;</hi> there are no <hi>weeds</hi> in that <hi>garden,</hi> no <hi>chaff</hi> in that <hi>barn,</hi> no <hi>Serpent</hi> gets into that <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> no <hi>unholy ones</hi> ever come in Heaven. <hi>[But of this hereafter.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that God will have <hi>wicked men curbed</hi> and <hi>reſtrained,</hi> that they ſhall not be ſo wicked as they would be, for they ſhall have <hi>ſome Righteous ones</hi> among them: He will put a <hi>ſnaffle</hi> upon them to keep them in; the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall reprove them, and tell them of their

                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From himſelf.</hi> 1. He is a <hi>juſt Lord, Zeph.</hi> 3.3. and from that Juſtice does execute judgement upon them, and deſtroy them. Juſt Judges on earth will not ſuffer notorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to live, how much more the <hi>juſt Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>a God of purer eyes then to behold evil; viz.</hi> without <hi>loathing</hi> and <hi>deteſtation:</hi> and <hi>cannot look upon iniquity;</hi> viz. with <hi>any approbation:</hi> and this <hi>purity</hi> of his Nature puts him upon deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked ones.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. He is <hi>a God to whom vengeance belongeth, Deut.</hi> 32.35. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.1. and <hi>the Lord God of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences will ſurely requite,</hi> Jer. 51.56.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the wicked:</hi> 1. They are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to deſtruction.</hi> Jer. 12.3. <hi>Pluck them out as ſheep for the ſlaughter, prepare them for the day of ſlaughter.</hi>
                  </p>

The <hi>Sodomites</hi> carried it highly againſt the Lord, and braved it againſt juſt <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19. but within a little time ſhowers of fire and brimſtone rained from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and deſtroyed them all. <hi>Haman</hi> braved it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jews, and thought to have deſtroyed them all, but he procured his own deſtruction by it. An <hi>high houſe</hi> falls ſometimes with the weight of it, ſo does an <hi>high</hi> and <hi>proud heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that we have no cauſe to <hi>fret,</hi> or be <hi>envious</hi> at them, for they ſhall ſoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.1, 2. Godly men are apt to it, <hi>I was envious at the fooliſh,</hi> ſayes <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:136185:31"/>73.3. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1, 2. but there's no cauſe if we conſider their <hi>end, Pſa.</hi> 73.17, 18. Deſtruction is their deſerved puniſhment. See <hi>Pſa.</hi> 37.35, 36. the higheſt Towers have the deepeſt falls; ſo they that are in <hi>higheſt dignity.</hi> Princes Favourites are not <hi>onvied,</hi> becauſe when they come down, their fall is great: ſo it was with <hi>Haman,</hi> and with other Favourites, <hi>Sejanus,</hi> that <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> made ſuch account of, but when he came down, his ruine was great. And this <hi>ſad Cataſtrophe</hi> have all wicked men, though they may ſpread their Plumes for a little time; and therefore there is no cauſe to <hi>fret</hi> becauſe of the wicked, nor to be <hi>envious</hi> at the workers of iniquity: a <hi>ſad blow</hi> at laſt kills them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee what reaſon there is why we ſhould not <hi>chuſe any of their wayes,</hi> Prov. 3.31. leſt we have a minde to be deſtroyed with them. They that go together in a way of ſin, ever go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſtruction, except mercy ſtep in to ſave ſome of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. A <hi>bundle of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, a bundle of filthy perſons,</hi> as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were, a <hi>bundle of Blaſphemers,</hi> and ſo of the reſt, they ſhall be all <hi>bound up in bundles to be burned</hi> together. They that chuſe the <hi>ſame way,</hi> go to the ſame <hi>ſad journeys end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee what a <hi>dreadful God</hi> we have to do with, and what cauſe we have to <hi>fear before him,</hi> that will thus deſtroy the wicked. How ſhould

                  <p n="5">5. We ſee the great <hi>mercy of God</hi> to any of us, that when we went on in a way of wickedneſs, and deſerved to be deſtroyed, that yet he would ſpare us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.10. As <hi>no ſinners</hi> were <hi>like us,</hi> ſo <hi>no God is like him,</hi> Mic. 7.18. How eaſily and juſtly might he have deſtroyed us, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to us according to our deſerts? his mercy hath been <hi>great,</hi> that he hath not dealt with us as we have dealt with him, and as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee that we need not be <hi>troubled</hi> when ſuch men bring their <hi>wicked devices</hi> to paſs, and proſper in their <hi>way of evil,</hi> for after all they muſt be deſtroyed; when they have run their <hi>run,</hi> they will come to ruine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee how much <hi>better</hi> it is to <hi>cut off right hands,</hi> and <hi>right feet,</hi> and to <hi>pluck out right eyes,</hi> ſins as dear as theſe members, rather then to be thus miſerably deſtroyed, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.43-46.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From God. 2. From the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:136185:33"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From God.</hi> 1. Though he may <hi>correct,</hi> and ſorely <hi>afflict</hi> his righteous ones, yet he hath alwayes made a <hi>difference</hi> between the righteous and the wicked. <hi>Noah</hi> and his family were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the univerſal Deluge, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom</hi> was delivered, when they were all burned with fire and brimſtone, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. God knows not how to deal <hi>alike</hi> with the one and with the other, but all ſhall ſee that the Lord puts a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> as he did of old between the Egyptians and the Iſraelites, ſo now between his righteous Servants, and wicked ones, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>commanded</hi> them to go out from the midſt of them that are to be deſtroyed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.45. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. Thus he did to <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19.17, 22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the righteous and the wicked, in the day when he brings deſtruction upon them. <hi>Jen.</hi> 46.28. <hi>Fear thou not, O Jacob my ſervant, for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee,</hi> &amp;c. and he will make his <hi>promiſe good.</hi> Men may promiſe, and break their word, but he will not, <hi>he is faithful that hath promiſed,</hi> not any thing of it ſhall fail, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.14. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.56.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath <hi>charged</hi> the Executioners of his wrath to <hi>ſlay utterly old and young</hi> of thoſe that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:136185:33"/>he will have deſtroyed, but <hi>not to come near</hi> any of his righteous that he would have ſpared, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.6. and he will ſee to it that they keep their charge; they ſhall not touch any of them, <hi>not an hair of their heads ſhall periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>loves</hi> the righteous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.8. and therefore will not deal with them as with the wicked. There's no man in his right minde will deſtroy thoſe he loves; how can we think then that the Lord will deſtroy the <hi>Righteous whom he loves,</hi> with the <hi>Wicked that are an abomination to him?</hi> he will ſurely put a difference between them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He hath <hi>ſaid,</hi> that others <hi>ſhall diſcern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not,</hi> Mal. 3.18. and this could not be, if God ſhould deſtroy the righteous with the wicked. If we may <hi>diſcern this,</hi> then ſurely God makes a <hi>broad difference</hi> betwixt the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Righteous ones themſelves.</hi> 1. They are <hi>vexed</hi> for the <hi>unlawful deeds</hi> of the wicked. The word tranſlated <hi>vexed,</hi> is <hi>tormented</hi> in the Greek, and is a Verb that comes of a Noun that ſignifies <hi>the torment of hell,</hi> as it is in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.28. The <hi>Sodomites filthy converſation</hi> was like <hi>the torment of hell</hi> to <hi>juſt Lot,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8. and God delivered him out of their <hi>helliſh puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:136185:34"/>
                  <p n="2">2. They <hi>cry</hi> and <hi>ſigh</hi> for the abomination of the wicked they live among, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 5, 6. and God will not have them deſtroyed, but <hi>marked</hi> out to be <hi>ſpared</hi> in the day of the deſtruction of the wicked. <hi>Mourners</hi> are Gods <hi>marked ones,</hi> and what deſtruction <hi>befalls others,</hi> they ſhall be ſure to <hi>eſcape.</hi> The <hi>Slaughter-weapon</hi> ſhall not come near ſuch mens doors that <hi>ſigh</hi> for ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are a people <hi>near to God,</hi> Pſa. 148.14. and will he deſtroy them with the wicked? he will never do it. Could any of us have the heart to deſtroy any that are <hi>near</hi> to us? <hi>How can I endure</hi> (ſayes <hi>Eſther</hi>) <hi>to ſee the evil that ſhall come unto my people? or how can I endure to ſee the drſtruction of my kinred?</hi> Eſth. 8.6. and can God then (think we) endure to ſee the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe that are ſo <hi>near to him?</hi> Surely he cannot do it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They do <hi>abominate</hi> and <hi>deteſt</hi> the wayes of wicked men. <hi>An unjuſt man is an abomination to the juſt,</hi> Prov. 29.27. and how can we then think that God will <hi>deſtroy the rightcous with the wicked,</hi> whoſe <hi>wickedneſs</hi> is ſuch an abomination to them? it ſhould not come into our mindes that he will do ſuch a thing as this.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3.17. and will men throw away their <hi>Jewels</hi> among the <hi>Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh?</hi> will they caſt away their <hi>procious Pearls</hi> and <hi>Rubies</hi> among the <hi>mire</hi> and <hi>dirt.?</hi> will they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:136185:34"/>mix <hi>Diamouds</hi> and <hi>Dung</hi> together? Can we then once imagine that God ſhould caſt away his <hi>precious ones,</hi> with ſuch as are as <hi>droſs</hi> and <hi>dung?</hi> who can think ſo of the wiſe God? He may take away the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> as <hi>dung,</hi> but <hi>Abijah</hi> his Son, that had <hi>ſome good things found in him towards the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> was not ſo dealt with, he was a <hi>jewel,</hi> and therefore not buried in the dung, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.10, 13.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are his <hi>pleaſant Plant,</hi> Iſa. 5.7. <hi>a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vine,</hi> Jer. 2.21. <hi>fruitful Trees of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 61.3. and therefore will have them <hi>ſpared,</hi> they ſhall not be cut down as barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful ones be. God gave it in charge to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in time of war, <hi>not to cut down any fruitful Trees,</hi> but thoſe that were <hi>unfruitful,</hi> they were to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,</hi> and to <hi>cut down,</hi> Deut. 20.19, 20. and if he be ſo tender of <hi>fruitful Trees</hi> in a Field or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, that he would not have them deſtroyed; then ſure he will not cut down his own <hi>choice Plants,</hi> that bring forth pleaſant fruits to him.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But is it not ſaid,</hi> Ezek. 21.3, 4. <hi>that</hi> God will cut off the righteous and the wicked; <hi>it ſeems therefore that the one fares no better then the other, but both are alike in puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They are <hi>both</hi> wrapped up in <hi>temporal puniſhments</hi> ſometimes, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.47. the <hi>green tree</hi> as well as the <hi>dry:</hi> But the righteous are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes delivered from <hi>eternal puniſhments,</hi> which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:136185:35"/>the wicked are deſtroyed with, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They oftentimes are <hi>delivered</hi> from <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall evils,</hi> which the wicked are deſtroyed with; as <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they do <hi>ſuffer</hi> the like temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is in mercy to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ſome greater evil.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are ſome righteous <hi>onely in their own eyes,</hi> and in the repute of others, and <hi>they</hi> may well be yoked with the wicked both in <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>eternal puniſhments:</hi> ſo that the truth is where it was, That God will not deſtroy the righteous with the wicked, nor ſhall the one be alike puniſhed as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee how <hi>good</hi> the Lord is to his <hi>righteous ones,</hi> that doth ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly put a difference between them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: they have done enough againſt him, which hath deſerved deſtruction, and for which he might juſtly do it, but he <hi>ſpares them, as a man does his ſon that ſerves him,</hi> Mal. 3.17. He <hi>pities them, as a father does his children,</hi> Pſal. 103.13. He will not <hi>ſmite them</hi> as he <hi>ſmites others,</hi> Iſa. 27.7, 8. they ſhall be preſerved, when others are deſtroyed: God will deal <hi>better</hi> with the one then with the other, and they and the other ſhall ſee it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee what cauſe of <hi>thankefulneſs</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:136185:35"/>ones have, that they are better <hi>cared for</hi> then others be, for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. it is God that hath made the difference betwixt them and others, and he muſt have the glory of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1. His <hi>grace is magnified</hi> by it, that we and others have any difference made betwixt us. Let us ſhout forth <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> for this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee the truth of that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Righteouſneſs delivereth from death,</hi> from eternal deſtruction, and that is the worſt deſtruction that is. The <hi>ſecond death</hi> is the ſoreſt death, and that every righteous one is <hi>ſaved from.</hi> The Serpent may <hi>hiſs,</hi> but it cannot <hi>bite,</hi> the <hi>ſting</hi> is gone, and therefore the danger is over. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. <hi>O death, I will be thy plagues,</hi> ſayes God; and theſe <hi>plagues</hi> are <hi>killing plagues</hi> to Death, it will never live more, and therefore cannot hurt the righteous.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that the righteous is indeed more <hi>excellent then his neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12.26. for God puts a great difference between them and others, he will not deſtroy them with the wicked: they are his <hi>brands</hi> that he will <hi>pluck out of the fire;</hi> his <hi>precious ones,</hi> that he will not caſt away with the <hi>dung;</hi> his <hi>gold,</hi> that he will not throw out with the <hi>droſs;</hi> his <hi>rare ones,</hi> that he will hang out for glory and beauty, and ſave from ruine and perdition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that all our <hi>love is too little</hi> for him
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:136185:36"/>that ſaves us out of the fire, when others are burnt up in it, that frees us from that deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that wicked men fall headlong into. Heart and Soul, and all that is with us, is too little for him; the fulleſt ſtream, and ſtrongeſt current of our affections, the united forces of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bowels, are not enough for him. Our love in the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of it, cannot come up in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to his; it's not a <hi>drop</hi> to his <hi>Sea,</hi> a <hi>beam</hi> to his <hi>Sun,</hi> a <hi>ſtream</hi> to his <hi>Fountain,</hi> a <hi>bucket</hi> to his <hi>Well,</hi> a <hi>ſpark</hi> to his <hi>Fire:</hi> He is <hi>all love</hi> to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8, 16. but Oh how <hi>little</hi> is ours that we expreſs to him!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee what we may <hi>expect,</hi> if <hi>calamitous times</hi> ſhould come, that <hi>it will be well with the righteous,</hi> Iſa. 3.10. there will be a difference made between them and the wicked; yea, though they ſhould <hi>both be killed,</hi> yet a great difference ſhall be made, they ſhall not be deſtroyed with that <hi>great deſtruction</hi> that the wicked are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with; they may be <hi>ſinged,</hi> but not <hi>burnt,</hi> they may be <hi>blacked by their ſmoke,</hi> but not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in their fire.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the nature of their Charity:</hi> It is <hi>that,</hi> that 1. <hi>Hopeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.7. that is, All things that <hi>may be hoped,</hi> that there is any <hi>probability</hi> and <hi>likelyhood</hi> of.

                  <p n="2">2. It <hi>Believeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.7. that is, All things that are <hi>to be believed.</hi> Charity is not blinde and fooliſh, to believe every thing, but it <hi>believeth what may be believed,</hi> and ſo from that belief <hi>hopes the beſt,</hi> even of the <hi>worſt place</hi> that is.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Lords Providence,</hi> 1. In <hi>permitting</hi> good and bad to be together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.30. <hi>Tares</hi> are permitted to be among the <hi>Wheat</hi> untill the end of the world, which is meant by the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> as Chriſt expounds it, <hi>ver.</hi> 39.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the nature of their Hope:</hi> 1. It is of <hi>things that are not ſeen,</hi> Rom. 8.24. ſo <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> here hoped for that he ſaw not.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From God:</hi> 1. He is very <hi>ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,</hi> Pſal. 86.5. Neh. 9.17. at leaſt ſo as to remit the puniſhment. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew this full well, and therefore made bold to <hi>intercede</hi> for wicked <hi>Sodom.</hi> Some men are of that diſpoſition, that they are <hi>eaſie to be intreated,</hi> and <hi>ready to forgive;</hi> much more God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He will do <hi>much</hi> for thoſe with whom his people have been Sojourners, and that puts them upon prayer for them. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew, that though <hi>Sodom</hi> was a <hi>vile place,</hi> yet it had ſuffered <hi>Lot</hi> and his family to dwell there, and therefore prayes the rather for them that they may be ſpared, at leaſt if there were ſuch a <hi>conſiderable number</hi> of ſuch as he was.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Righteous ones themſelves.</hi> 1. Their <hi>preſence</hi> is delightful to him, and may prevail much for thoſe they live among, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their <hi>prayers</hi> are not loſt that are put up for them; they are <hi>accepted,</hi> though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not for ſuch a ſinning people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their <hi>grief</hi> for the ſins of ſuch is taken notice of; as <hi>Lots</hi> was for <hi>filthy Sodom,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their <hi>tears</hi> that they ſhed are <hi>bottled</hi> up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.8. and <hi>booked.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="6">6. Their <hi>pains</hi> they take with them to make them better, is conſidered of, as <hi>Lots</hi> among the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> Gen. 19.7, 8.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Petitioners themſelves:</hi> 1. They are <hi>friends to God,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.7. Iſa. 41.8. Jam. 2.23. and <hi>what</hi> or <hi>whom</hi> may not they prevail for?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their <hi>hearts</hi> are <hi>faithful to God,</hi> Neh. 9.8. and ſuch may prevail much for others: their Prayers ſhall not be loſt, but be like <hi>the bowe of</hi> Jonathan <hi>that turned not back,</hi> and <hi>the ſword of</hi> Saul <hi>that returned not empty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are in <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> Neh. 9.8. and ſuch cannot be <hi>denied,</hi> he cannot ſay them <hi>Nay</hi> in any thing they ſue for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>obedient to God</hi> in difficult com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8, 17. and what may not ſuch prevail for?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are men <hi>weaned</hi> from the world, and live and converſe much in another world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9, 10. Such a man was <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they that are <hi>ſuch,</hi> may get any thing they ask, whoever they be that they make ſuit for. All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered, no wonder that they do ſo deſire that <hi>God would not deſtroy,</hi> but <hi>ſpare a wicked place,</hi> eſpecially for thoſe <hi>good</hi> that peradventure may be found therein.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We ſee that the moſt <hi>excellent of Saints</hi> bear great good will to the worſt of ſinners. <hi>Abraham,</hi> that prime Believer, wiſheth well to wicked <hi>Sodom,</hi> that it might not be deſtroyed: and ſo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:136185:42"/>did. For, ſins committed <hi>under the Goſpel,</hi> exceed <hi>Sodoms wickedneſs;</hi> they <hi>love thoſe</hi> that <hi>hate them,</hi> and out of love pray for them. Such will not be brought to <hi>think that they love them,</hi> yet they are many times got into a corner to pray for them, even when they are tearing them with their tongues, and ſpeaking and doing all the evil they can againſt them. <hi>For my love</hi> (ſayes <hi>David) they are mine enemies; but I give my ſelf to prayer,</hi> Pſal. 109.4, 5. Godly ones are <hi>full of love,</hi> even to their adverſaries, and <hi>wiſh well</hi> to them that wiſh <hi>no good,</hi> but <hi>evil</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee how <hi>wickedly</hi> they do, that ſo ill requite the Saints that wiſh them well, that they are the men that are had in greateſt abomination with them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.27. Publicans will <hi>love thoſe that love them,</hi> Mat. 5.46. theſe therefore are worſe then they, who <hi>hate them that love them,</hi> and <hi>perſecute ſuch as pray for them.</hi> Deformed perſons hate the greateſt beauty: ſo do theſe hate thoſe that ſhew forth the greateſt beauty of love to them, in praying for them. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had been in <hi>Sodom,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> was, they would have no more regarded him, then <hi>Lot</hi> was regarded by them. Such <hi>requital</hi> the beſt of Saints muſt meet with, and look for from an evil world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee what <hi>love</hi> there is in heaven, if there be ſo much on earth: Oh! how do the <hi>Saints</hi> love one another there! if while on earth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:136185:43"/>they <hi>love their enemies,</hi> what inexpreſſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable love do they ſhew to their <hi>friends in heaven! Love,</hi> that is <hi>the bond of perfection,</hi> will tye perfection to it ſelf, for <hi>perfect</hi> will our love to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> be. Here are <hi>ſparks,</hi> but there our love will be on a <hi>flaming fire;</hi> here are <hi>little points,</hi> but there our love will be in the <hi>full Circumference</hi> of it; here are <hi>atomes</hi> and <hi>motes</hi> of it, but there it will be in the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of it; here there are but <hi>drops,</hi> but there will be a <hi>Sea</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee what <hi>love</hi> there is in God himſelf, that is <hi>Love it ſelf,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.8. He is the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Spring,</hi> all that is in the Creature flows from him: and this <hi>love</hi> he hath ſhewn to us, when we were <hi>enemies</hi> to him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. Ours is <hi>little,</hi> but his is <hi>much. Abraham</hi> may wiſh well to <hi>Sodom,</hi> and a few other Cities more, but Gods love is <hi>infinite,</hi> he loves <hi>the whole world of his Elect,</hi> Joh. 3.16. It's <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>large;</hi> it's a <hi>Sun,</hi> a <hi>Sea:</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> is not ſo full of <hi>light,</hi> nor the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>water,</hi> as he is of <hi>Love.</hi> This <hi>Spring</hi> never dries, this <hi>Light</hi> ever ſhines, this <hi>Sun</hi> never ſets, this <hi>Sea</hi> never fails, this <hi>Fire</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes out, but <hi>warms</hi> our hearts, and will warm them to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee how <hi>previous</hi> righteous ones be in the Lords ſight, that Believers dare <hi>for their ſakes</hi> deſire of God to ſpare the worſt of ſinners.

                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From God the Lord; or from Chriſt Jeſus, for he is this <hi>Lord</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:136185:45"/>interceded to in behalf of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as Interpreters make account. 2. From the Righteous. 3. From the Wicked.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord Jeſus:</hi> 1. He is that <hi>juſt and righteous one,</hi> Acts 7.52. and therefore out of juſtice cannot ſlay the righteous with the wicked. Juſt men will make more account of the righteous then of the wicked; how much more the <hi>juſt Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He <hi>loves Righteouſneſs, and hates Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Pſal. 45.7. and he cannot poſſibly ſuffer it, that <hi>the Righteous ſhould be as the Wicked,</hi> or <hi>ſlay the Righteous with the wicked;</hi> and therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants may wiſh ſuch a thing as that to be <hi>far from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>beholds</hi> the righteous with an amiable face, and looks upon them with an eye of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.7. and therefore cannot but put a great difference betwixt the one ſort and the other, and cannot put them in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that the one ſhould be as the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is the <hi>Judge of all the earth;</hi> ſo the Text: and therefore cannot but do <hi>right. [But of that I muſt ſpeak more in the next Doctrine, and therefore onely touch upon it now.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is wont to be <hi>merciful</hi> to righteous ones that fear him, and he cannot leave his old wont. This the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> pleads, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.132. <hi>Look thou upon me and be merciful to me, as thou
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:136185:45"/>uſeſt to do to thoſe that fear thy Name.</hi> It would not be according to his <hi>cuſtom</hi> and <hi>wont,</hi> it would be otherwiſe then he uſeth to do, if he ſhould not be <hi>merciful</hi> to ſuch: and how ſhould he then <hi>ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He will render to a man his work, and cauſe every man to finde according to his wayes, and therefore <hi>humble ones</hi> may earneſtly wiſh it to be <hi>far from him, to ſlay the Righteous with the wicked.</hi> Job 34.10, 11. ſo <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Far be it from God, that he ſhould do ſickedneſs, and from the Almighty, that he ſhould commit iniquity: for the work of a man ſhall he render unto him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Righteous:</hi> 1. They are <hi>tender of his Name,</hi> and therefore he cannot but be tender of them, and let the righteous be in better caſe then the wicked. They are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>love his Name,</hi> Pſal. 69.36.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are ſuch as it is <hi>a joy to them to do judgement,</hi> and if ſo, then much more will the Lord do judgement, and rejoyce ſo to do: and therefore cannot but put a difference between the righteous and the wicked.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are ſuch as are <hi>more excellent</hi> then others be, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. many wayes <hi>more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;</hi> in their <hi>deſcent,</hi> being <hi>born of God,</hi> Joh. 1.13. in their <hi>honourable Relation,</hi> being <hi>Brethren to Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 20.17. Heb. 2.11, 12. in their <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual food,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſts fleſh</hi> that they feed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:136185:46"/>upon, and his <hi>blood</hi> which they drink of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55. in their <hi>ſpiritual clothing,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 61.10. 1 Cor. 1.30. in their <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> having the <hi>Angels to encamp about them, and miniſter to them,</hi> Pſal. 34.7. Heb. 1.14. in their <hi>great Inheritance,</hi> Mat. 25.34. Now being all theſe wayes <hi>more excellent then others,</hi> it muſt needs be that a difference muſt be made between them, and that the righteous ſhall not be as the wicked; and <hi>far be it from the Lord</hi> that it ſhould be otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they onely,</hi> that God hath any <hi>glory by</hi> upon earth: the wicked bring in none to him, but put all the diſhonour they can upon him; and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. he is <hi>tender of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and how then ſhould he <hi>ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked?</hi> We may plead it with the Lord as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked,</hi> or <hi>that the Righteous ſhould be as the Wicked, that be far from thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are ſuch as he takes <hi>pleaſure in,</hi> Pſal. 149.4. and how can this be, if he ſhould <hi>ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked?</hi> See <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are ſuch as he <hi>meets in a way of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> Iſa. 64.5. and if <hi>the Righteous ſhould be as the Wicked,</hi> how could this be? he would rather meet them like an enemy, then in a friendly way, if he ſhould <hi>ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:136185:46"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Wicked:</hi> 1. They are ſuch as the Lord <hi>abhors,</hi> his very Soul <hi>hates them,</hi> Pſal. 11.5. and ſhould not Suppliants then plead with the Lord, that he would put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and his righteous ones? See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>appointed to wrath, deſtinated to deſtruction,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.9. and can the Lord then put no difference between them, but that the one ſhould be as the other? This we ſhould plead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They <hi>fear not God,</hi> Pſal. 55.19. and how ſhould it be then but that he ſhould put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thoſe that <hi>fear him,</hi> and <hi>thoſe that fear him not?</hi> God forbid that it ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are ſuch as <hi>hate the Righteous,</hi> Prov. 29.27. and therefore that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked, we ſhould plead it with the Lord, that it may be <hi>far from him to do after ſuch a manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>the Children of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.10. and that the <hi>Children of God</hi> ſhould be in no <hi>better condition</hi> then the <hi>Children of the Devil,</hi> that we ſhould ſtrongly plead with him, <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are ſuch as whoſe <hi>ſins cry for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> as theſe <hi>Sodomites</hi> ſins did. Now that the righteous and they ſhould ſhare <hi>alike in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> this were hard, and we ſhould plead hard
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:136185:47"/>with God, that he would not <hi>do after this manner; That be far from thee,</hi> ſayes <hi>Abraham, that be far from thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Suppliants have, and ought to have a <hi>ſpecial eye</hi> at the <hi>glory of God</hi> in their Supplications that they bring before him. Thus does <hi>Abraham</hi> here, he is very tender of the glory of God, would have no diſhonour to reflect upon him, by <hi>ſlaying the Righteous with the Wicked; That be far from thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to do after this manner.</hi> Gods glory is <hi>that</hi> that we ſhould aim at in all our holy addreſſes in Prayer to him, as the <hi>firſt Petition</hi> in the Lords Prayer holds out to us: that's the <hi>mark</hi> we muſt ſhoot at in all we do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. and much more when we come to pray to him, we are to have reſpect to the <hi>glory of his Name,</hi> and that no reproach may be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Holy One. His <hi>Name</hi> is worth more then the Lives and Souls of all the men in the world, and infinitely above all created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that they that <hi>plead moſt with God</hi> in behalf of others, are moſt like to <hi>Abraham;</hi> for ſo did he. Oh how earneſt was he in behalf of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that <hi>the Reghteous might not be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Wicked!</hi> They that <hi>pray</hi> muſt <hi>plead,</hi> if they would walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham; That be far from thee,</hi> being twice repeated, ſhews,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:136185:47"/>that (as his) ſo our Prayers ſhould be <hi>earneſt</hi> that we bring before the Lord. <hi>Incenſe</hi> was not offered without <hi>fire;</hi> nor our Prayers without <hi>fervency,</hi> Jam. 5.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee what <hi>true love</hi> godly ones expreſs one towards another. <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>tender love</hi> prayes, that <hi>the Righteous may not be deſtroyed with the Wicked.</hi> The truth is, there is no <hi>true love,</hi> but an <hi>image onely</hi> of it in other men; but that which is <hi>love in truth,</hi> is onely found among godly ones: They are partakers of the Divine Nature, and therefore ſhew forth love one to another. <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.8. and where his Image is, as is in all the Saints, there is ſweeteſt love expreſſed one to another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee wherein <hi>true love</hi> is expreſſed; it is <hi>evidenced</hi> in our earneſt Prayers that we put up one for another. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo judged, and therefore <hi>pleads with God</hi> in behalf of thoſe <hi>Righteous ones</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> that they may not be <hi>deſtroyed with the wicked.</hi> There's no <hi>true love</hi> like that that is expreſſed in our fervent Prayers one for another. Prayer is an <hi>holy breathing, Lam.</hi> 3.56. and our love one to another is never breathed forth more, then in our Prayers each for other. They have <hi>a ſweet breath,</hi> and their love is ſweet that pray moſt fervently one for another.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that they that do not <hi>plead earneſtly</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:136185:48"/>in Prayer for <hi>Righteous ones,</hi> are neither heirs of <hi>Abrahams faith</hi> nor <hi>love</hi> to thoſe righteous ones that he earneſtly intreated for: there are thoſe that pray ſlightly and ſuperficially for them, but <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>fervent in ſpirit</hi> for thoſe he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; <hi>That be far from thee, That be far from thee, that the Righteous ſhould be as the Wicked.</hi> Hollow, ſlight, perfunctory Prayers for others, argue that there's neither <hi>faith</hi> nor <hi>love</hi> in ſuch an heart. That fire is <hi>gone out</hi> that the bellows <hi>cannot kindle;</hi> ſo if the blaſt of our deſires be not <hi>fervent</hi> for others, the fire of <hi>love</hi> is quite put out.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee that if we be to be earneſt and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in our Prayers for <hi>others,</hi> how fervent are we to be for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and for thoſe that are and ought to be as dear as our own Souls? for our own Country, and the Land of our Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Oh how earneſt ſhould we be that both <hi>we</hi> and <hi>they</hi> may be ſpared, and not deſtroyed, when other <hi>wicked ones</hi> ſhall not eſcape! we ſhould <hi>double</hi> our Requeſts for our ſelves and them, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here does, that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>they</hi> may be preſerved from the fire of his indignation. The very Heathens had a love to their Country, and their utmoſt deſires and endeavours were for the preſervation of that, as we ſee in <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and others of them. Oh what deſires then ſhould Chriſtians have, as for <hi>themſelves,</hi>

To <hi>plead hard</hi> in behalf of others, and <hi>double our files,</hi> and be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in our requeſts for them. We cannot be too earneſt in our deſires for them; <hi>that</hi> that we ſue unto God for, is worth the ſtrongeſt, of our affections to be put forth in our Prayers for them: So <hi>Abraham</hi> thought, and ſo ſhould we.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To call upon us to be <hi>thankeful</hi> when we pray earneſtly for others; for, we naturally <hi>ſlack our pace</hi> in this: it is therefore ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,

                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="3">3. He is <hi>the one Law-giver,</hi> and therefore the whole Scripture is called <hi>The word of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 3.16. and being the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> it's meet he ſhould be <hi>Judge</hi> alſo.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He <hi>cannot but do right,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. He is called <hi>the juſt one,</hi> Acts 7.52. and juſt Judges do that which is <hi>right;</hi> how much more he?</p>

                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>commands</hi> other Judges to <hi>do right,</hi> Deut. 1.16. <hi>judge righteouſly between every man and his brother.</hi> So 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6, 7. And he that

He <hi>complains</hi> of <hi>wrong dealing,</hi> and of the <hi>proceeding of wrong judgement.</hi> Hab. 1.4. <hi>The law is ſlacked, and judgement doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compaſs about the righteous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrong judgement proceedeth.</hi> Now if the Lord finde fault himſelf with wrong dealing, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do wrong himſelf, but will do right.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſons of the ſecond Branch,</hi> Why we are to <hi>plead</hi> it with him as he is Judge to <hi>do right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is not meet that his <hi>Name</hi> ſhould have any <hi>diſhonour</hi> put upon it, and therefore we are to plead with him to <hi>do right:</hi> for if he could poſſibly do any iniquity (which he cannot) it would reflect diſhonour upon him. <hi>Petit.</hi> 1. in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe if he <hi>did not right,</hi> he could not <hi>judge the world:</hi> it is eſſential to his Office of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judge, to <hi>do righteouſly,</hi> Rom. 3.5, 6. and that we may plead with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe his <hi>honour is exalted</hi> by <hi>doing right.</hi> If <hi>Righteouſneſs exalt a Nation,</hi> then much more <hi>the Judge of all Nations;</hi> and therefore we may well plead it with him.</p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:136185:57"/>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe <hi>all mouthes are ſtopped</hi> when <hi>right is done.</hi> It is ſo when Judges on earth do right, they that would <hi>cavil,</hi> cannot tell how to do it: So it is when <hi>the Judge of all the Earth does right,</hi> then no man dare open his mouth againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe when this Judge doth <hi>right,</hi> there will be <hi>loud acclamations</hi> made. As when a King upon the Throne <hi>judgeth righteouſly,</hi> all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will ſound forth his praiſe: ſo when this King judgeth righteouſly, all will ſing aloud his praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. <hi>throughout.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe when he doth <hi>right</hi> he will be <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he did that that was <hi>right</hi> between the two women that contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the <hi>living</hi> and <hi>dead childe,</hi> that <hi>All Iſrael heard of the judgement that the King had judged, and they feared the King,</hi> 1 Kin. 3.28. Oh how will then <hi>the Judge of all the Earth,</hi> when he does <hi>right,</hi> be <hi>feared</hi> of all his people? and this we may well plead.</p>

There are thoſe that will <hi>turn aſide the right of the poor,</hi> and <hi>will not help the afflicted in the gate,</hi> but will deal <hi>unrighteouſly,</hi> when it is in the power of their hand to help and ſuccour helpleſs ones. The Judge of all the Earth <hi>cannot

He ſhines with the <hi>rayes</hi> and <hi>beams</hi> of his Righteouſneſs, but they have not ſo much as <hi>one beam</hi> of this Sun to ſhine forth with, but are black and dark all over, and covered with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,</hi> as the sky is covered with thick Clouds and darkneſs. In ſtead of <hi>putting on righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and being <hi>clothed with it,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, Job 29.14. and making <hi>judgement a robe, and a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> they put on <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and tye it faſt as a garment to them. Many ſuch there are in the world, but they have nothing of the Image of Chriſt upon them; <hi>The Judge of all the Earth cannot but do right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that <hi>this Judge</hi> will cauſe all unjuſt Judges to ſtand before <hi>His</hi> Judgement-ſeat, and paſs a righteous Sentence upon <hi>them:</hi> Though they would <hi>do no right,</hi> yet they ſhall <hi>have right</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> from him at the <hi>great day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi> Then he will reckon with them for all their <hi>cruelty and injuſtice,</hi> for all the <hi>wrong</hi> that they have done to his poor ones; for all the <hi>tricks</hi> and <hi>querks</hi> that they have deviſed to put off Law, and Juſtice, and Equity: then they ſhall <hi>hear</hi> his righteous Sentence pronounced upon them, and <hi>feel</hi> the ſtroke of his righteous hand againſt them.

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="5">5.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In that he is a <hi>Great King,</hi> Pſal. 47.2. &amp; 95.3. and they that are great Kings have open ears, and inlarged hearts, to grant the deſires of thoſe that ſue to them. <hi>Ask on my mother</hi> (ſayes <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>for I will not ſay thee nay,</hi> 1 King. 2.20. <hi>What is thy petition, Queen Eſther? and it ſhall be granted thee: And what is thy requeſt? and it ſhall be performed to the half of the Kingdome.</hi> Great Princes think it their honour thus to do, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.2. how much more the Lord, who is the <hi>Great King over all the earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that his Servants <hi>bleſs him</hi> for this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18, 19, 20. When Princes are <hi>bountiful</hi> in granding the deſires of their Suppliants, they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:136185:62"/>come off with great thanks: and <hi>their</hi> inlarged hearts in thankfulneſs, ſhews that he is a God hearing and granting the <hi>deſires</hi> that they put up to him. Great <hi>acknowledgements</hi> argue great <hi>favours,</hi> great <hi>thanks,</hi> great <hi>bounty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that his Servants have <hi>this confidence,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.14, 15. and their confidence in him does not <hi>deceive them. Confidence</hi> in an unfaithfull man, is as <hi>a broken tooth, and a foot out of joynt,</hi> Prov. 25.19. it will deceive him as a <hi>broken tooth</hi> will him that eateth, and a <hi>foot out of joynt</hi> him that goeth: but <hi>confidence</hi> in the <hi>faithful God</hi> will never deceive a man, but let him go to him in way of <hi>Requeſt</hi> for any thing that he needs that ſtands with his glory, and he ſhall have it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that <hi>he hears the cry of the young Ravens,</hi> Pſal. 147.9. and if ſo, much more will he <hi>hear the cry of his Servants that ſue to him.</hi> Ravens are of the worſt kinde of fowls, of a devouring nature, that feed of dead Carrion, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in want, and after their manner <hi>cry to God;</hi> and if he will hear ſuch a <hi>croking cry</hi> as that, much more will he hear the <hi>cry of his believing Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> and grant them what they ſue unto him for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In that <hi>he is not ſought in vain.</hi> Iſa. 45.19. <hi>I ſaid not to the ſeed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.</hi> Men may be <hi>ſued</hi> unto, and <hi>ſought,</hi> and <hi>deſired</hi> to do <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> but ſuch ſuits may be in vain, and their expectations fruſtrate, and they may
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:136185:62"/>get no grant of their deſires; and be as <hi>the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles little ones, that came to the pits and found no water, but returned with their veſſels empty,</hi> Jer. 14.3. and ſuch men that they <hi>ſue to</hi> may be like <hi>Jobs brethren,</hi> that <hi>deceived him as a brook, and as the ſtream of brooks,</hi> (which ſeem to <hi>promiſe</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but <hi>perform</hi> nothing) <hi>which vaniſh away by the heat, and are conſumed out of their place,</hi> Job 6.15, 16, 17. Thus it is with men that are <hi>ſought unto,</hi> they will miſerably fail thoſe that <hi>ſue to them,</hi> and all their requeſts will be in vain: But never any of <hi>the ſeed of Jacob ſought the Lord in vain,</hi> but found him a faithful God, having an open ear to hear, and an open heart and hand to give and grant the requeſts of thoſe that ſue unto him. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.19.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In that he <hi>delights</hi> in our Prayers: <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight:</hi> Cant. 2.14. <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice.</hi> Now <hi>Prayer</hi> being ſo <hi>delightful</hi> to him, being as it were ſweeteſt muſick and melody to him, what wonder is it if he <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>grants</hi> all that we fue unto him for. If <hi>Herod,</hi> that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in a <hi>dancing Minion,</hi> would come off with <hi>whatſoever ſhe ſhould ask, to half a Kingdome,</hi> Mark 6.22, 23. Oh! what will not the Lord come off with to thoſe that ſue to him? <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ask ſhall be granted to them,</hi> Mat. 21.22. Joh. 16.23. God will not be <hi>out-bidden</hi> by man:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:136185:63"/>what he is <hi>delighted with</hi> ſhall have a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then any King on Earth can give.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How does he hear them, and grant their deſires that they put up to him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Sometimes <hi>very ſpeedily,</hi> Iſa. 58.9. <hi>Thou ſhalt call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer; thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, Here I am:</hi> which is a marvellous condeſcendency in the great God, and hath more in it then I am able to expreſs; it is like that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11. as if Prayer had the <hi>command</hi> of the great God. But withall it holds out his <hi>ſpeedy anſwer</hi> of Prayer: So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24. <hi>while they are yet ſpeaking, &amp;c. Nehemiah</hi> got a <hi>ſpeedy anſwer</hi> to his ejaculatory Prayer, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4.-8. So <hi>Ezra</hi> had a <hi>ſpeedy anſwer,</hi> Ezra 8.23. So <hi>Elijah</hi> had a <hi>ſpeedy anſwer,</hi> 1 Kings 18.36, 37, 38, 39. Prayer hath <hi>wings</hi> to fly ſpeedily <hi>to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and to bring a ſpeedy anſwer <hi>from heaven.</hi> See <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Graciouſly,</hi> Exod. 22.27. <hi>When he crieth unto me, I will hear; for I am gracious.</hi> As God is gracious to us many other wayes, ſo in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner <hi>in hearing our prayers,</hi> and <hi>granting what we ſue unto him</hi> for. A Prince is gracious, in granting the requeſts of his Suppliants; ſo is the Lord in hearing and granting our requeſts. <hi>Prayer of faith</hi> is crowned with <hi>favour</hi> from a gracious God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Juſtly,</hi> ſo as to grant <hi>all</hi> that we ſue unto
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:136185:63"/>him for, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22. He hath a <hi>full hand,</hi> and a <hi>large heart,</hi> and will <hi>fulfill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of them that fear him.</hi> The Creatures, the fuller they be, the more they communicate of their fulneſs; the <hi>Sun,</hi> that is full of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> the <hi>Stars</hi> that are full of <hi>ſweet influences,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> that is full of <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>Clouds</hi> that are full of <hi>Rain,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> that is full of <hi>good fruits;</hi> All theſe communicate of their <hi>fulneſs.</hi> God is a <hi>full one,</hi> and <hi>of his fulneſs we all receive:</hi> He is <hi>infinitely full,</hi> and therefore can and will fulfill all our deſires, and give a full grant to all our requeſts that we put up to him. All the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fulneſs is <hi>derivative</hi> and <hi>temporary,</hi> but his is <hi>of</hi> and <hi>from himſelf,</hi> and continues a <hi>full one</hi> to all eternity, and therefore more communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive then <hi>any,</hi> then <hi>all</hi> of them: So as our Prayers get a <hi>full anſwer</hi> from him, and a <hi>full grant</hi> of all we ſtand in need of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sometimes <hi>wonderfully,</hi> and to admiration. How <hi>wonderfully</hi> did the Lord hear <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the <hi>Suns ſtanding ſtill?</hi> Joſh. 10.12, 13, 14. How <hi>wonderfully</hi> did he hear <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> deſire, in its <hi>going back ten degrees?</hi> 2 Kings 20.4. How <hi>wonderfully</hi> did God anſwer <hi>Elijah</hi> in the <hi>two Captains with their fifties?</hi> 2 Kings 1.9-12. God is <hi>a Wonder-working God,</hi> and ſometimes to admiration he hears the prayers, and grants the deſires of his Servants that ſeek to him. We are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:136185:64"/>not able to count what wonders have been done by Prayer: That wonder of the <hi>Thundring Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions Prayer for Rain,</hi> when the Emperour and his Army were in ſuch diſtreſs, which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their Prayer, was a rare wonder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hears them <hi>conſtantly;</hi> there's no time that they come before him ſo as they ought, but he hears, and grants what they deſire of him. Pſal. 55.17. <hi>Evening and morning, and at noon will I pray, and cry aloud, and he ſhall hear my voice.</hi> Let me come before him when I will, I ſhall get an anſwer. There are ſome Princes on earth that never deny their Suppliants, but are all upon the <hi>giving hand:</hi> That Emperour that ſaid, <hi>He never ſent away any that came petitioning ſad from him,</hi> was ſuch a Prince. Now if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on earth will do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> us, Oh how much more will God himſelf at all times grant that that we ſue unto him for?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Alwayes in time of need.</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>Let us come boldly to the throne of Grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need.</hi> God does all for us according to our <hi>need;</hi> and when we <hi>need</hi> a grant of our Requeſts, we ſhall be ſure to have it. Wiſe men will give where they ſee there's <hi>need,</hi> much more the wiſe God. When we cannot tell how to be <hi>without a grant,</hi> then a <hi>grant comes</hi> from Heaven; when we know
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:136185:64"/>not what to do <hi>without it,</hi> then it is <hi>given,</hi> then the God of Heaven is liberal in his grants to us.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Why is the Lord a God hearing Prayer, and granting the deſires of his Servants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. From himſelf. 2. From his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. 3. From the Duty of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From himſelf.</hi> 1. He hath <hi>promiſed</hi> that he will <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>grant,</hi> Mat. 21.22. Joh. 16.23. and what he promiſeth he will perform: what <hi>he ſpeaks with his mouth, he will fulfill with his hand,</hi> 1 King. 8.24. Men often break their promiſes, and belie with their <hi>deeds</hi> what they utter in their <hi>words;</hi> but God <hi>cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1.2. and therefore what he <hi>ſpeaks</hi> ſhall be done, <hi>He will not alter the thing that is gone out of his lips,</hi> Numb. 23.19. if he ſay that he will <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>grant,</hi> he will make it good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hereby <hi>encourageth</hi> all fleſh to come to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. They have many beggars at their doors that are <hi>bountiful givers:</hi> Thoſe Courts of Princes are thronged with Suiters, where the Prince's ears are open to hear, and their hands open to give: So it is with Gods <hi>Doors,</hi> many there are that lye at them; and with his <hi>Court,</hi> multitudes of Suiters throng to it with their Petitions, when Gods ear is open to hear, &amp; his hand open to give. They are <hi>encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> to come, when he will not ſay them <hi>nay.</hi> It is obſerved, That that gracious Emperour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:136185:65"/>had very many that made ſuit to him; how much more then will our gracious God have many that will make ſupplication to him?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hereby <hi>bindes us</hi> the faſter to himſelf in love and duty. <hi>Every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon:</hi> and all look at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much obliged to them that are bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in giving to them: but Oh how much more does God <hi>oblige us</hi> to him by thoſe liberal <hi>grants</hi> that he makes to us! We are ready to ſay as <hi>David</hi> does, Pſal. 116.16. <hi>Truely we are his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we are his ſervants,</hi> and deſire that none may ſhew our ſelves more faithful then we. That Traitor that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was ſo kinde unto, not only in pardoning his Treaſon, but in giving him great things, and preferring him to higheſt Honour, look'd at himſelf as one that was <hi>deeply engaged</hi> and <hi>obliged</hi> to him, and proved the moſt faithful and loyal Subject to him of all other ever after: So does God <hi>binde</hi> and <hi>tye us</hi> to himſelf in <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> by his bountifull grants that he makes to us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hereby <hi>honours</hi> himſelf by having an <hi>open ear</hi> to hear, and an <hi>open hand</hi> to give and grant what we ſue for. He is <hi>abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Exod. 34.6. and this way ſhews it. It is obſerved of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he <hi>gave the Queen of Sheba all that ſhe asked, beſides what he gave her of his royal bounty,</hi> 1 Kings 10.13. and he <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:136185:65"/>himſelf</hi> in ſo doing: How then does <hi>God honour himſelf</hi> in giving us <hi>all our deſire,</hi> and <hi>what we ask?</hi> there's no <hi>Royal bounty</hi> like his, he grants <hi>like a King,</hi> and <hi>like Himſelf:</hi> Other Kings have their <hi>Royal Grants,</hi> but none ſuch as his are.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From his Servants.</hi> 1. They <hi>expect</hi> his hearing of their Prayers, and a grant of their deſires from him, and wait patiently upon him; and this gets a grant. Pſal. 40.1. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me and heard my cry.</hi> There's nothing loſt by <hi>patient waiting</hi> at the Courts of Kings, the deſires of ſuch are granted at laſt: much leſs is any thing loſt by waiting upon the Lord, he will come with a <hi>full hand</hi> at laſt, and we ſhall have a <hi>full grant</hi> of what we ſue for. The <hi>Husbandman waits</hi> for the precious fruits of the earth, and at length <hi>hath them;</hi> ſo ſhall we by <hi>waiting</hi> have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bleſſings of Heaven brought in to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They <hi>believe</hi> that they ſhall be heard, and a <hi>Royal Grant beſtowed upon them,</hi> and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22. Faith is a <hi>Key</hi> that opens all Locks: though <hi>Mercies</hi> ſhould be locked up from us, yet <hi>this Key</hi> will make way for the bringing them <hi>forth</hi> to us: <hi>Knock, and it ſhall be opened to you,</hi> Mat. 7.7. The <hi>door of Mercy</hi> may be faſt barred and locked, but a <hi>knock by Faith</hi> will open it to us, and open all the Treaſures of his bounty for us, that we may ſhare in them.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:136185:66"/>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>unwearied</hi> in their deſires, and that gets a grant: The <hi>woman of Canaan</hi> would not be diſcouraged, nor faint at ſo many denials and repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſes, but went on in an <hi>unwearied</hi> courſe of ſuing and pleading, and this got a grant of what ſhe asked, and what ſhe would, <hi>Mat</hi> 15.28. They that are not <hi>weary</hi> in their deſires, may have <hi>what they will,</hi> God cannot tell how to <hi>deny ſuch:</hi> If we be not <hi>weary of asking,</hi> God will not be <hi>weary of giving</hi> and granting. This crowns our Deſires, and brings in all to us. We want not <hi>bleſſings,</hi> ſo long as we want not <hi>knees to bow</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They <hi>wreſtle</hi> for a grant of their deſires, and ſo prevail, and become <hi>Princes with God, Gen.</hi> 32.28. and <hi>what</hi> that wreſtling was, we ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4. They that wreſtled in the <hi>Olympick Games,</hi> if they got the Victory were <hi>crowned;</hi> much more ſhall they be crowned with a <hi>Royal Grant</hi> from Heaven, that wreſtle and prevail with God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They <hi>ask according to his will,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.14, 15. and that prevails. Our Requeſts, when bounded within the compaſs of Gods will, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain every thing at Gods hand. <hi>Eſthers</hi> Petitions were bounded within the compaſs of the Kings will, <hi>If it pleaſe the King;</hi> and, <hi>If I have found favour in the ſight of the King,</hi> grant me <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> Eſth. 5.8. &amp; 7.3. and whatever ſhe <hi>thus
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:136185:66"/>asked,</hi> ſhe had a grant of it: So when we pray, and frame all our Petitions according to <hi>his will,</hi> he hears and grants all that we thus ſue unto him for.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They <hi>ask earneſtly</hi> and <hi>fervently,</hi> and that prevails, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. How earneſt and fervent was <hi>Elias?</hi> and what an anſwer had he from Heaven? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.36, 37, 38. Fervent Prayer, like fire, aſcends to Heaven, and gets a grant there of <hi>all we ask,</hi> and of all that is the deſire of our hearts: we need never doubt of the <hi>ſpeeding</hi> of our Prayers, if offered up with <hi>this fire.</hi> This <hi>Incenſe,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. will <hi>aſcend to God</hi> and to his <hi>Throne,</hi> and finde acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Duty of Prayer.</hi> 1. It is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> Heb. 13.15. 1 Pet. 2.5. and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that were offered up under the <hi>Leviticall Law</hi> were accepted, and were of <hi>aſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God;</hi> and ſo is this of <hi>Prayer by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> His <hi>Incenſe</hi> perfumes our Prayers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is <hi>the lifting up of the Soul,</hi> Pſal. 25.1. and this holds out <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>earneſt expectation</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> of having what is ſued for; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.15. the poor man is ſaid <hi>to lift up his ſoul to his hire and wages,</hi> which is tranſlated, <hi>He ſets his heart upon it:</hi> ſo in Prayer we <hi>lift up our ſoul to God,</hi> to have thoſe things we ask <hi>granted</hi> to us; and ſuch a <hi>lifting up of the ſoul to God</hi> gets a grant from him.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:136185:67"/>
                  <p n="3">3. It is compared to the <hi>Incenſe,</hi> Pſal. 141.2. <hi>Let my prayer come before thee as the Incenſe:</hi> now that was of <hi>a ſweet ſavour,</hi> and aſcended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. So our Prayers are <hi>ſweet to God,</hi> and aſcend unto his Throne, are accepted, and get a grant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is compared to the <hi>Mincah,</hi> or <hi>Offering</hi> that was boiled in the Frying-pan, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. which was <hi>boiled in oyle, and offered in the evening.</hi> Our Prayers being boiled in the <hi>oyle of the Spirit,</hi> and we <hi>praying in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 20. theſe Prayers are accepted of God, and get a grant of all we ask through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee what a <hi>broad difference</hi> there is between <hi>our God,</hi> and the <hi>Idols</hi> that others pray unto: Our God is <hi>a God hearing Prayer,</hi> but <hi>Idols cannot hear. Baal's</hi> worſhippers, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.26. <hi>called from morning to noon, ſaying, O Baal hear us: but there was no voice, nor any that anſwered.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.12. <hi>Moab ſhall go to his ſanctuary to pray, but ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</hi> Idols <hi>have ears, but they hear not,</hi> Pſ. 115.6. but our God that we pray to hath an <hi>hearing ear,</hi> and grants us all that we ſue unto him for: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any had cauſe to ſay that <hi>he turns a deaf ear</hi> to them when they pray aright; his ears have alwayes been <hi>open</hi> to their Prayers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee what great <hi>encouragement</hi> we have to come to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. we may go <hi>when we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:136185:67"/>will,</hi> and be ſure to ſpeed; we may pray as <hi>often as we will,</hi> and have our deſires granted: he will not turn away from us, but give us what we come for. Some Princes will <hi>chide away</hi> thoſe that ſue to them, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the oppreſſed Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.17, 18. but our God that we ſue unto never diſcourageth them that make ſuit and ſupplication to him, but gives them all the encouragement that may be, is <hi>found of them when they ſeek him, when they ſearch for him with all their hearts,</hi> Jer. 29.13. they ſhall never go <hi>away empty</hi> from his doors, but go <hi>loaden</hi> with their laps full, with their hearts full, and all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires like the <hi>widows veſſels,</hi> 2 Kings 4.6. ſhall be <hi>filled full:</hi> we ſhall never ſay we have <hi>gone to God,</hi> but we have <hi>got ſomething;</hi> there's a rich Treaſury in Heaven, and we have carried away <hi>not a little</hi> from it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee what cauſe we have to <hi>bleſs the Lord</hi> for his <hi>bounty</hi> to us, in granting our Requeſts that we put up to him: There's no friend that is kinde to us in granting our deſires, but we judge worthy of <hi>thanks;</hi> Oh how <hi>thankeful</hi> ſhould we then be to God, that hears and grants what we ſeek unto him for? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.20. It is the Lords <hi>Tribute</hi> that he looks for, and if we would not grudge to pay the King <hi>his Tribute,</hi> being a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duty,</hi> Rom. 13.7. then we ſhould chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully come off with the <hi>Lords Tribute,</hi> and pay
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:136185:68"/>it in <hi>holy Praiſes</hi> to him. The truth is, we do but <hi>bungle</hi> at it here, and do it not workman-like; but we ſhall one day do it better, when we are joyned in this heavenly melody with that <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels, and bleſſed Souls in glory.</hi> But in the mean time we muſt be doing <hi>ſomething</hi> this way for all his bounties to us, and if not ſo well as we <hi>would,</hi> yet we are to do it as well as we <hi>can,</hi> and long for the time when we ſhall perform it better.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that though we have but a <hi>few friends</hi> on earth, yet we have <hi>One</hi> in Heaven that <hi>will not fail us. There is a friend (Solomon</hi> ſayes) <hi>that ſticketh cloſer then a brother,</hi> Prov. 18.24. and ſuch an one is a rare jewel, and hardly to be found: but though he be not to be found <hi>on Earth,</hi> yet God is <hi>ſuch a friend,</hi> and will hear and grant what we ſue unto him for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee the truth of that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.28. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God:</hi> it muſt needs be ſo, conſidering <hi>what a God he is</hi> that we go unto, that <hi>hears our</hi> Prayers, &amp; <hi>grants</hi> us all that we ask of him. We make account that it's good to go to a Father or Friend to make our wants known, that we may have a ſupply: Oh how good is it then to go to ſuch a Father and Friend as God is?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee what cauſe we have to <hi>delight in the Lord,</hi> that we may have the deſires of our hearts
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:136185:68"/>granted to us. Seeing he is ſo willing to grant, let us take the way that he preſcribes for this, and that is by <hi>delighting in him,</hi> Pſal. 37.4. He that <hi>delights</hi> in his friend, may have any thing of him, how much more may they that <hi>delight themſelves in the Almighty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee that we can never come off with <hi>love enough</hi> to him, who is <hi>a God hearing prayer,</hi> &amp; granting our requeſts to us. We would think that man worthy of our love, that granted our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in asking; but Oh what love ſhould <hi>he have,</hi> that gives us all that we deſire of him! Our love is but a <hi>little Rivulet</hi> and <hi>Stream,</hi> but he deſerves a <hi>full Sea;</hi> our love is but a <hi>little ſpark,</hi> but he deſerves that it <hi>flame forth;</hi> our love is but a <hi>drop,</hi> but he deſerves that it ſhould be a <hi>full flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fountain</hi> that's never dry.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee how <hi>unwearied</hi> we ſhould be in <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to him, that thus <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>grants:</hi> How loyal are Subjects to Royal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they come off bountifully to them? How dutiful and obedient are Servants to their liberal Maſters? they are ready at hand to ride, run, go, do any thing for them: Oh how loyal ſhould we then be to ſuch a <hi>bountiful King?</hi> and how dutiful to ſuch a <hi>liberal Maſter</hi> as God is, that gives us what we ask of him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſee how we may be <hi>followers of God,</hi> by bearing the cries of poor <hi>afflicted ones,</hi> and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:136185:69"/>granting their deſires: ſo does God to us, and ſo ſhould we to them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. There are thoſe that <hi>turn away from the cry of the poor,</hi> but <hi>they ſhall cry and not be heard.</hi> But ſeeing God hears us, if we would <hi>follow him</hi> we muſt hearken, and come off liberally to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.38.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We ſee that none of our Prayers <hi>ſhall be loſt</hi> that we put up to him, none of them ſhall miſcarry. We may go to men with our Suits, and be <hi>put off,</hi> and turned away, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts may be ſlighted, and made nothing of; but God dealeth not ſo with us when we come before him in Prayer, he <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>grants,</hi> and <hi>gives to all liberally, and upbraideth not,</hi> Jam. 1.5. Some Princes have torn in pieces what their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners have brought before them, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Valens</hi> did to one of his noble Captains that had done him great Service, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of him, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> but our God never does ſo to his Suppliants, but they have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable anſwer, and a liberal grant; they go to <hi>a Throne of Grace,</hi> and finde <hi>grace to help in time of need:</hi> their Prayers come loaden with <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> and they return home <hi>bringing their ſheaves with them. Naomi</hi> complained, that ſhe <hi>went out full, but returned empty:</hi> but we go out <hi>empty</hi> to him, and return, <hi>full.</hi>

                  </p>

If we could pour out our Souls into his boſome, all were <hi>too little</hi> for him.

                  <p n="6">6. To <hi>rejoyce</hi> that we go to ſuch a God as both <hi>can,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> hear and grant. When <hi>power</hi> and <hi>will</hi> meet together, what ſhould hinder us

Prayer of Faith is <hi>that</hi> that is <hi>very pleaſing to him,</hi> Cant. 2.14. and <hi>accepted of him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. or
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:136185:73"/>elſe he would never give us <hi>in kinde</hi> what we ask of him: it is muſick and melody in his ears, or elſe he would not give us <hi>the ſame thing</hi> that we deſire of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee with what <hi>alacrity</hi> and <hi>chearfulneſs</hi> we ſhould come before the Lord in Prayer, for we are ſure to ſpeed, and ſometimes to have <hi>the very thing</hi> that we ſeek unto him for: it is but <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>have,</hi> and who then would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to pray to him? The little Birds lift up their heads and eyes when they take in a drop or two into their mouthes; Oh how chearfully then ſhould we lift up our eyes to heaven <hi>to the God of Heaven,</hi> that gives us not <hi>drops,</hi> but that thing <hi>in kinde</hi> that we ask of him, out of which we day <hi>drink abundantly, and be ſatisfied?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee what <hi>wrong</hi> they do to themſelves, that <hi>reſtrain prayer before God,</hi> Job 15.4. they miſs of many a fair bleſſing that they might carry home with them, yea in the things that they deſire that they might enjoy: They ſpare to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and ſpare to <hi>ſpeed;</hi> they might have <hi>what they would,</hi> did they bring their Petitions with them: They need <hi>be careful for nothing,</hi> could they <hi>in every thing make their requeſts known to God,</hi> Phil. 4.6. Could men but <hi>pray,</hi> and leave their Petitions with the Lord, they might have <hi>what they deſire</hi> given in to them; but their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of prayer</hi> before him, cauſeth a <hi>reſtraint of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:136185:73"/>bleſſings</hi> that might be poured into their boſoms.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that God <hi>mindes</hi> whatever it is that we pray to him for, for he gives ſometimes <hi>the very thing</hi> that we ask of him. Princes may ſometimes <hi>take</hi> their Suiters Petitions into their hands, but afterward <hi>lay them aſide,</hi> and never look into them; but our God does not ſo, but he conſiders well what we ſpeak in his ears, and grants <hi>the very thing</hi> we pray for. Prayer is of more reckoning with him, then to lay aſide the Petitions of his Suppliants, and never regard what is contained in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee how <hi>willing</hi> we ſhould be to grant the deſires in kinde that others make to us, if we be able, and have it by us; this is to be <hi>like God himſelf,</hi> for ſo does he to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.42. We fall ſhort this way, but we have no ſuch pattern to imitate as God is, and who would not be <hi>like to God?</hi> It is the glory of a man, the more he reſembleth the God above; it is an honour to him that comes neareſt to him in Workmanſhip, that is the rareſt and choiceſt Artificer: Oh what is it then to come up to <hi>that perfection</hi> in ſome meaſure that is in God himſelf! it's a rare thing to be a follower of him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee that if God give us all we ask <hi>in kinde,</hi> then we are to ſuit our <hi>thanks</hi> according to the <hi>benefits beſtowed</hi> upon us. If he hath given us <hi>ſignal mercies,</hi> ſo ſhould our <hi>praiſes</hi> be

                  <p n="7">7.

                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee what <hi>love</hi> we owe to him, for anſwering our deſires in <hi>the kinde of them.</hi> We would love him that gave us our deſires that we

                  <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>promiſed,</hi> that for the ſake of his <hi>Righteous ones</hi> he will deliver great places. <hi>Job</hi> 22.30. <hi>He will deliver the Iſland of the innocent;</hi> and his Promiſes are <hi>ſure words.</hi> If a King ſay

                  <p n="3">3.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>orders</hi> it in his <hi>Providence,</hi> that when he hath any <hi>evil</hi> to bring upon a place, he takes away <hi>his Righteous ones before that evil come,</hi> Iſa. 57.1. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was <hi>taken away,</hi> before the City where he lived was taken by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.

Mr. <hi>Whately</hi> of <hi>Banbury</hi> was <hi>tranſlated to a better plaee,</hi> before the Town was taken in the late Wars: And all theſe were removed a <hi>little before</hi> ſuch judgements came. The <hi>Corn</hi> is <hi>gathered into the barn,</hi> before the <hi>Swine</hi> are ſent into the field; ſo the godly are taken away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any remarkable judgement come, which

                  <p n="5">5. He looks at his Righteous as ſuch as <hi>the world is not worthy of,</hi> Heb. 11.38. for they keep off judgement from the world, though they be ſo <hi>vilely</hi> and <hi>unworthily</hi> uſed in the world.

                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From his Righteous ones.</hi> 1. They <hi>pray for the places they live in,</hi> that the Lord would be pleaſed to <hi>keep off judgements,</hi> and <hi>continue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> to them; and theſe Prayers of theirs prevail: God cannot tell how to deny the ſuits that they preſent before him; <hi>Lot</hi> for <hi>Zoar,</hi> Gen. 19.20, 21.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:136185:77"/>Their Prayers are ſo <hi>delightful to him,</hi> Prov. 15.8. Cant. 2.14. that even places <hi>devoted to deſtruction</hi> ſhall be ſpared for their ſakes: the ſmoke of the <hi>incenſe</hi> of their Prayers <hi>aſcends to God and to his Throne,</hi> and ſo prevails, that Gods anger cannot ſo ſmoke againſt thoſe places, as otherwiſe it would certainly do, were it not that God had ſuch regard to the Prayers of his Righteous ones in their behalf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>vexed with their filthy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tormented day by day with their unlawful deeds,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8. and this <hi>affliction of their ſouls</hi> that they ſuffer among ſuch wicked ones, God hath ſpecial regard unto, and for the ſake of ſuch <hi>mourners</hi> will ſpare thoſe places while they continue among them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They by their <hi>preſence</hi> keep off the ſtroke of <hi>Gods vengeance.</hi> Great is the power of the very <hi>company</hi> of godly ones to bear off, and ſhield off a <hi>judgement,</hi> when it is ready to fall upon a <hi>wicked place.</hi> Evil men do not <hi>think</hi> ſo, but they ſhall <hi>know it</hi> when the righteous are removed from them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are very <hi>tender of his Name,</hi> and therefore he will ſo <hi>tender them,</hi> that for their ſakes he will do <hi>great things,</hi> yea <hi>for a ſinning people.</hi> How <hi>tender</hi> was <hi>Lot</hi> of the <hi>glory of God,</hi> that could not endure to hear and ſee what he did, without <hi>vexing his righteous ſoul from day to

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6.

We are therefore to enjoy their favour <hi>weanedly,</hi> for when <hi>duſt</hi> is <hi>laid in the duſt,</hi> what can that duſt do for us?</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>whatſoever we will</hi> that we may have a grant of; <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.7. and therefore it well becomes us to ask ſuch things in an humble manner.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee that they that are of a <hi>proud ſpirit</hi> when they come to pray before the Lord, cannot expect that their Prayers ſhould be accepted; for <hi>humility</hi> is that that God looks for, and that which well becomes us when we pray to him. Cloth of Gold does not better become a Prince, then <hi>humility</hi> does a Petitioner before the Lord. Humble ſuiters are the <hi>ſpeeders,</hi> Luke 18.13, 14. Pride is a <hi>Rag</hi> of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:136185:88"/>the <hi>old man,</hi> and it is not comely to be ſeen in rags before ſuch a King as the Lord is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee a reaſon why Prayer is called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> Pſal. 141.2. Mal. 1.11. The Incenſe was to be <hi>beaten ſmall,</hi> Exod. 30.36. and by the beating of it very ſmall, was ſhadowed out the <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>contrition</hi> of our hearts in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that <hi>Confeſſion of ſin</hi> is one of the chief ingredients that Prayer is to conſiſt of, for therein we chiefly humble our ſelves in coming before the Lord in Prayer, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.40, 41, 42. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks much of it in his Prayer, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. and we cannot be too ſerious in it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that Popiſh Prayers according to the number of their <hi>Beads,</hi> which they do ſo glory in, are of no account with God, becauſe they <hi>truſt in them,</hi> and come not from the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their hearts; for <hi>He reſiſteth the proud, but gives grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. The more <hi>humble</hi> we be when we pray, the more <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> we may expect from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that <hi>without faith</hi> there's no put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up an humble Prayer. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith made him pray ſo <hi>humbly:</hi> So that woman of <hi>Canaans faith</hi> was that that <hi>humbled</hi> her heart in Prayer, that ſhe <hi>fell at Chriſts feet.</hi> It was the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>faith</hi> that made him confeſs that he was not worthy that Chriſt <hi>ſhould come under his Roof,</hi> and that he was not worthy <hi>to come to him,</hi> Luke
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:136185:89"/>7.6, 7. Faith is an <hi>humbling grace,</hi> and the more of it we bring with us in Prayer, the more <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> decks that Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee a reaſon of that in Pſal. 51.17. <hi>The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> and that in Pſal. 34.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken heart:</hi> It muſt needs be ſo, for they pray in humility of heart before him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee that they that are truly godly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be <hi>humble</hi> in Prayer, it is their property, and they look at it as their <hi>duty</hi> ſo to be.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee that they that <hi>flant</hi> it in their Prayers with quaint words, and curious expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they know not what <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>godlineſs</hi> mean: it's ill in Preaching ſo to do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1, 2, 4. but much worſe in Prayer.

                  <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Wherein does this boldneſs conſiſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. In ſpeaking <hi>freely</hi> all that we have to ſay to him: So the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> holds out, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. it properly ſignifies <hi>A liberty to ſpeak all that we can ſpeak,</hi> or <hi>A freedome to ſpeak all our minde.</hi> Men may ſometimes cut us off, and make us break off before we have ſpoken all we would, and bid us <hi>forbear,</hi> as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.16. <hi>Amaziah</hi> did to the Prophet: but the Lord would have us ſo <hi>bold</hi> with him, as to ſpeak all
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:136185:90"/>we have to ſay in his ears; he will not interrupt us, or break off our ſpeech, but give us <hi>liberty</hi> to ſpeak all our minde to him. <hi>That's the firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It conſiſts in <hi>an humble taking upon us to ſpeak</hi> in his Preſence: ſo did <hi>Abraham</hi> here; ſayes he, <hi>I have taken upon me, though but duſt and aſhes, to ſpeak to the Lord;</hi> that is, I have been <hi>bold</hi> to ſpeak to him, or I have <hi>freely begun</hi> to ſpeak to him, as the Hebrew word is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It conſiſts in <hi>ſeeking to gather</hi> and <hi>gain upon God</hi> in our requeſts that we put up to him. Thus <hi>bold</hi> was <hi>Abraham</hi> here, he ſeeks to <hi>gain</hi> upon God in his addreſſes to him; as we ſhall ſhew more hereafter, if the Lord will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It conſiſts in <hi>coming frequently,</hi> and as <hi>often as may be</hi> into his Preſence. They that go often into the Kings Preſence are bold with him, as Favourites uſe to be: ſo they that are often with the Lord are <hi>bold</hi> with him. So were <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> that had their <hi>conſtant walks with God,</hi> Gen. 5.22, 24. &amp; 6.9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. An <hi>humble boldneſs;</hi> they may be <hi>humbly bold</hi> with him. <hi>Abraham</hi> takes upon him to <hi>ſpeak to the Lord,</hi> but acknowledgeth in an humble manner that he is but <hi>duſt and aſhes.</hi> Petitioners that are <hi>bold</hi> with their Princes, yet they ask upon their knees for what they have a deſire to have: So here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>familiar boldneſs;</hi> we may be <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly bold</hi> with him. <hi>Abraham</hi> familiarly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with God,</hi> and God with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.33.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>reverend boldneſs:</hi> we pray to him as to a <hi>Father,</hi> and therefore muſt give him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, as other Children do to their Fathers: Heb. 12.28. <hi>Let us have grace, whereby we may ſerve him acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a <hi>comely boldneſs;</hi> we muſt not be rude in his Preſence, but pray in <hi>comely manner,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the Preſence of the great God. They that Petition to Princes, carry themſelves in a <hi>beſeeming manner,</hi> and according to the Majeſty they come before: So muſt we, we may be <hi>bold</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:136185:91"/>with the Lord in praying to him, but ſo as to conſider <hi>who</hi> we are before, and <hi>who</hi> we have to deal with: we do it ſo as becomes ſuch a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty as God is. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> did, he was <hi>bold,</hi> but he was not <hi>rude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a <hi>boldneſs</hi> that keeps it's <hi>diſtance. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was <hi>bold</hi> with the Lord, but looks at him as <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as the Lord infinitely above him that was vile and baſe, <hi>duſt and aſhes:</hi> So may we be <hi>bold</hi> in praying to him, but look that we know our <hi>diſtance,</hi> we muſt look at God as <hi>he is,</hi> and look at our ſelves as we are.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a <hi>boldneſs</hi> that <hi>exalts Gods grace,</hi> that we may be ſo bold with him. <hi>Abraham,</hi> in all the <hi>boldneſs</hi> that he uſed, aimed at this, that the grace of God might be <hi>exalted,</hi> in not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſparing <hi>Sodom,</hi> that wicked place and people: Such ſhould our <hi>boldneſs</hi> be.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is an <hi>holy boldneſs:</hi> Abraham <hi>does not, dares not</hi> ask any thing that is diſhonourable to the Name of God, but though he <hi>take upon him to ſpeak to the Lord,</hi> yet it is an <hi>holy boldneſs;</hi> he requeſts for nothing but that that may well ſtand with <hi>holineſs</hi> to deſire, and with Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to <hi>grant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is a <hi>boldneſs full of love</hi> to thoſe we pray for: <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>bold</hi> with God, but his <hi>love</hi> carried him out to make ſo bold with him; he was earneſtly deſirous that <hi>Sodom</hi> might be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:136185:92"/>and it was out of tender <hi>love</hi> to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that he thought might be amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Why may Believers be thus bold with God in praying to him?</hi>

They that are bold with Princes, as Favourites be, are the <hi>delights</hi> of thoſe Princes, elſe they durſt not be ſo bold with them: So Believers muſt needs be <hi>Gods delight,</hi> ſeeing they are and may be ſo bold with him in praying to him: Cant. 7.6. <hi>How fair and pleaſant art thou, O love, for delights?</hi> Hence it is that the Lord calls his Church <hi>Hephzibah, My delight is in her;</hi> and <hi>Beaulah,</hi> that is, <hi>Married: for as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom delighteth over his Bride, ſo he delighteth over his people,</hi> Iſa. 62.4, 5. They have his heart, and are his <hi>delight,</hi> they are the <hi>deſire of his eyes,</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:136185:93"/>and that which his heart is ſet upon: It is ſo with a mans wife, and much more with Believers that are eſpouſed and married to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee what great <hi>honour</hi> God puts upon Believers, that are and may be ſo <hi>bold with him.</hi> Every one may not be bold with a King, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Suits and Supplications before him; they are <hi>honourable ones,</hi> and ſuch as he <hi>delighteth to honour,</hi> that may be ſo bold as to take upon them to ſpeak to him: Oh how honourable then are <hi>they</hi> in the ſight of God, and how does he delight to honour Believers, that take the <hi>boldneſs</hi> to take upon them to <hi>ſpeak to the Lord?</hi> They are the Noble ones, and the great Peers of his Kingdome, how-ever they be <hi>little</hi> in their own eyes, and ſtyle themſelves but <hi>duſt and aſhes,</hi> yet they are <hi>great</hi> in his account, and he ſtyles them <hi>Excellent,</hi> and <hi>Honourable ones,</hi> Pſa. 16.2, 3. and Prov. 12.26. farre above other men: they are the <hi>Grandees</hi> in his Court and Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that when they come to <hi>glory,</hi> they will be farre greater then now they are: for here their honour is much veiled by ſin, they are <hi>black,</hi> and <hi>the Sun hath looked upon them,</hi> and their honour is <hi>ſtained</hi> by the afflictions they ſuffer; the Devil and the World caſt all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour they can upon them, as they did upon Chriſt Jeſus, as he ſayes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.49. but God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours them <hi>here,</hi> and if ſo, much more will he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:136185:93"/>honour them when they come in Heaven. Here they are <hi>bold with God,</hi> and it is their honour ſo to be; but no honour like to <hi>that,</hi> when they ſhall be <hi>ever with him,</hi> and <hi>ſee his face,</hi> and by that Beatifical Viſion ſhall be <hi>made like to him,</hi> and <hi>bear the Image</hi> of the heavenly one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.49.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee how marvellouſly the Lord <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends</hi> to <hi>duſt and aſhes,</hi> that they that have <hi>that ſtyle</hi> may be ſo bold with him, as to <hi>take upon them to ſpeak to the Lord:</hi> Oh how <hi>low</hi> does he ſtoop to ſuch! no <hi>humility</hi> like his. This is not the manner of men, this is not the manner of great Princes to come thus low; but <hi>God</hi> would <hi>teach them,</hi> and <hi>teach us all,</hi> to condeſcend and become low, and ſhews himſelf a <hi>pattern of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> that we may be the more aſhamed of our pride, and learn to ſtoop of ſuch a great one as he is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee a reaſon why ſome Believers have made ſo <hi>bold</hi> with ſome great men in ſome caſes, and have ſpoken ſo freely to them, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7, 8, 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.16. They that may be ſo <hi>bold with God,</hi> and take upon them to <hi>ſpeak to him,</hi> may be bold much more with men, when called to it: if with the <hi>potter,</hi> then with the <hi>clay;</hi> if with the <hi>great God</hi> in our ſuits to him, much more with the <hi>greateſt of men,</hi> when there's cauſe for it.</p>

                  <p n="6">6.

We do not go to a Prince that will terrifie us with his <hi>looks,</hi> that will fright us with his <hi>words,</hi> that will drive us from his <hi>preſence;</hi> but to ſuch an one as does <hi>encourage us</hi> to be <hi>bold with him</hi> in Chriſts Name. He is <hi>that Friend</hi> at Court, that we are more bold then welcome, and that he will ſee to it that we ſhall have a gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From the Believers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>a Bountiful giver,</hi> he hath more bleſſings then <hi>one,</hi> he hath a <hi>full hand,</hi> and a <hi>large heart;</hi> an <hi>open hand,</hi> and a <hi>free liberal heart,</hi> Pſal. 115.16. Jam. 1.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He gives <hi>above what we ask or think,</hi> Eph. 3.20. and therefore <hi>one Requeſt</hi> granted ſhould not content us, but we ſhould deſire <hi>more</hi> of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:136185:95"/>ſuch an one as he is, that is able to give above all our deſires.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath commanded us to <hi>open our mouthes wide,</hi> Pſal. 81.10. to ask <hi>more,</hi> and to inlarge our deſires: and if he <hi>command this,</hi> we may well do it; we cannot anſwer it, but muſt be diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient except we <hi>ask more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath promiſed, that <hi>whatever we ask, believing we ſhall receive;</hi> and therefore it is not the grant of <hi>one Requeſt</hi> that ſhould content us, but we ſhould ask <hi>more,</hi> Mat. 21.22. and all his <hi>promiſes</hi> are punctually performed, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.24.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hath put a <hi>Royal ſpirit</hi> in <hi>giving</hi> into ſome men, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.20. <hi>Ask on, my Mother,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>for I will not ſay thee nay.</hi> So 1 Kings 10.13. <hi>He gave the Queen of Sheba all ſhe asked, beſides what he gave her of his royall bounty.</hi> See <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.2. and if ſo, he will never come ſhort of men in royalty and bounty in <hi>giving,</hi> and therefore we are not to reſt in <hi>one grant,</hi> but ſue for more.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He knows that we have <hi>many wants,</hi> and when <hi>one</hi> is ſupplied, we need <hi>another,</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi> to that, and ſo on to a <hi>multitude;</hi> and <hi>many troubles</hi> to be removed, and therefore when we ſue for <hi>one,</hi> and have it granted, we muſt ſue for <hi>more:</hi> we are <hi>poor and afflicted</hi> many wayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.6, 19. and therefore muſt go on in our ſuits, and ask more.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:136185:96"/>
                  <p n="7">7. He is pleaſed when he ſees us again and again to <hi>renew our Requeſts</hi> to him: He is not like ſome men, that make it an argument why they will not give again, becauſe they have <hi>given once,</hi> Jam. 1.5.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He hath an <hi>inexhauſtible Treaſure,</hi> that by the renewall of our ſuits, and asking more, we cannot <hi>draw dry.</hi> He hath a <hi>rich Myne</hi> by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. He is a <hi>full one</hi> that commands all bleſſings both in temporal and ſpiritual things, Pſal. 50. 1 Pet. 5.10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themſelves:</hi> 1. Their <hi>faith</hi> is hereby <hi>ſtrengthned.</hi> Judg. 6.37-40. <hi>Gideons</hi> faith in Gods deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his hand, was <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> by his <hi>ſecond Requeſt</hi> that he made to God concerning the <hi>fleece:</hi> and the <hi>faith</hi> of Gods Servants needs <hi>ſtrengthning;</hi> even the Diſciples of Chriſt were men of <hi>weak faith,</hi> Mark 4.40. ſo that Chriſt could not tell how to put the name of <hi>Faith</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their thankfulneſs is hereby more and more <hi>inlarged.</hi> The more Petitions any make to a Prince, the more full of <hi>Thanks</hi> they come off with when they are granted. Now <hi>thanksgiving</hi> is <hi>Heavenly work, Angelical, Seraphical work,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> that God is <hi>glorified by,</hi> Pſal. 50.23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They do <hi>gain,</hi> and <hi>gather</hi> upon God by renewing their ſuits: ſo did <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ever
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:136185:96"/>in his <hi>renewed Requeſts</hi> got ſomething, and went away a <hi>gainer.</hi> A new Petition to a Prince by one in favour gains ſomething: ſo Believers upon every renewed Petition ſhall finde themſelves to go away with ſomething. Even the poor at the doors that come <hi>often,</hi> loſe not their labour, but get ſomething, are not ſent empty away; how much leſs then will God deny his poor ones that renew their requeſts to him? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are the <hi>more welcome</hi> the oftner they come. Men may be <hi>weary of us</hi> the oftner we come to them: <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.17. <hi>Withdraw thy foot</hi> (ſayes <hi>Solomon) from thy neighbours houſe, leſt he be weary of thee, and ſo hate thee.</hi> A man that comes <hi>ſeldome</hi> ſhall be welcome to another, but if he come <hi>often</hi> he will but be a burthen: but it is not ſo with thoſe that go <hi>often</hi> before the <hi>Lord,</hi> they are ever <hi>moſt welcome to him</hi> that come with <hi>new Requeſts</hi> oftneſt before him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They become <hi>more dutiful and obedient to him,</hi> if their renewed Suits be granted. So it is with all that <hi>ſue at Court,</hi> how obſequious and dutiful will they be? and ſo it is with thoſe that renew their Suits at the Throne of Grace; <hi>I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant,</hi> will each of them ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16. not in a Complemental-way, as ſometimes they do at Court, but in a ſerious way, ſo as <hi>dutiful ſervants</hi> ought to do.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They do by often coming <hi>increaſe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:136185:97"/>with God,</hi> and this is <hi>that</hi> that he likes <hi>well</hi> of, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. and we may well <hi>delight</hi> in; for no acquaintance like his.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They by coming before God, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their requeſts to him, ſhew forth <hi>the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs of their love to thoſe they pray for:</hi> and that the Lord is much <hi>delighted with,</hi> who is <hi>Love it ſelf,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.8.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They do by renewing their Suits to him, <hi>acknowledge his Bounty and Grace;</hi> and that he is able to give <hi>abundant ſupply</hi> to us in what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of him: and that cannot but be <hi>well-pleaſing to him.</hi> Princes are well pleaſed when they are looked at as <hi>bountiful</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> to their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants: ſo is God when his <hi>Grace is exalted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee what a <hi>bountiful God</hi> we go to, that gives us leave to come before him with <hi>new Requeſts,</hi> after he hath granted <hi>that</hi> that we <hi>asked before</hi> of him. Men are oftentimes <hi>niggards,</hi> and if they have done <hi>ſomething,</hi> they <hi>ceaſe giving:</hi> but our God is <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,</hi> and <hi>gives liberally to all, and upbraids not,</hi> Jam. 1.5. When we have gone <hi>once,</hi> and got what we <hi>asked of him,</hi> we may come <hi>again:</hi> and this Believers know, and therefore are encouraged to come again, and ſue for more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that the <hi>more faith</hi> any man hath, the <hi>more bold he may be with God,</hi> to put up <hi>new Requeſts</hi> to him. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>great Believer,</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:136185:97"/>and his <hi>faith</hi> puts him upon a <hi>new ſuit,</hi> after the <hi>old was granted.</hi> What may not Believers have? and therefore they will put in for it. <hi>Faith</hi> will fetch in any thing that a man would have: <hi>All things are poſſible to him that beleeveth,</hi> Mar. 9.23. and therefore the Believer will go on in his ſuits, and <hi>ask more</hi> after a <hi>former grant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that it is lawful to covet after more of the <hi>good things</hi> that God vouchſafes to give when we make our Requeſts to him. To covet after <hi>earthly things inordinately</hi> is ſin to thoſe that <hi>ſet their hearts upon them,</hi> Phil. 3.19. but to deſire of God <hi>other things,</hi> and to <hi>ask more,</hi> after we have already got <hi>ſome of our Requeſts granted,</hi> is <hi>that</hi> that we may do, and is an high <hi>Encomium</hi> of our Faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that <hi>one gift</hi> received from God makes way for <hi>another;</hi> the Believer takes it as a <hi>pledge</hi> that he ſhall have more. We preſume upon a friend ſometimes that hath done <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> at our asking, that he will do <hi>more;</hi> much more may we relie upon God when he does <hi>any thing</hi> at our requeſt, that he will do <hi>more.</hi> One favour begets another: When once God is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with</hi> to do <hi>ſomething</hi> at our requeſt, we may binde upon it that he will do <hi>more,</hi> and ſo take courage to <hi>renew our ſuits.</hi> So did <hi>Abraham</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee what our caſe is here in this world,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:136185:98"/>we are alwayes <hi>wanting ſomething,</hi> either for our ſelves or others; and when we have got a grant of <hi>one thing,</hi> we need <hi>another,</hi> and muſt renew our ſuits. We are made up of <hi>wants,</hi> and when we get <hi>one ſupplied,</hi> another <hi>looks us in the face,</hi> and beſpeaks a <hi>new Requeſt</hi> to be put up to the Lord for a <hi>freſh ſupply.</hi> This is our caſe and ſtate while we are in this world; as our <hi>troubles</hi> are many here, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. ſo are our <hi>wants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee that Believers know <hi>where ſupply is to be had,</hi> and therefore they go to God to make <hi>a new ſupply.</hi> He is a <hi>Fountain</hi> that they repair unto; a <hi>Spring</hi> that is never drawn dry; a <hi>Well</hi> that is ever full: and therefore if our pitchers have been filled <hi>once,</hi> they may be filled <hi>again.</hi> We know where we have had a <hi>good dole once,</hi> and it is but <hi>going again.</hi> Thus a Believer argues with himſelf: I have fared well <hi>once,</hi> and will <hi>try again;</hi> I have drunk at the <hi>Well,</hi> and have had my <hi>fill,</hi> and will <hi>go again</hi> for a freſh ſupply; the <hi>Spring</hi> is <hi>yet open,</hi> and I will <hi>repair thither again:</hi> God is able to grant me <hi>one Requeſt</hi> as well as <hi>another,</hi> and therefore I will ſeek to him yet again.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From his believing Suiters and Suppliants. 3. From the Grants themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord himſelf.</hi> 1. He is <hi>Rich unto all that call upon him,</hi> Rom. 10.12. and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enough by him, how can he but <hi>renew his grants,</hi> and give more when we ſue and ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for it. Rich men give according to their quality and condition; ſo God that is <hi>rich in mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>a great King,</hi> Mal. 1.14. and will give according to the ſtate of a King: and they <hi>(as I ſaid)</hi> that are Kings on earth, ſtick not at <hi>renewed Grants;</hi> and how then ſhould he that is <hi>the great King over all the earth?</hi> Pſal. 47.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His <hi>Mercies are new every morning,</hi> Lam. 3.23. the Sun is not oftner ſeen by us, then his <hi>Mercies;</hi> they look us in the face <hi>every day.</hi> The Light of the day does no more fail us, then his <hi>mercies</hi> do. The Morning is not oftner renewed upon us, then his <hi>mercies</hi> are: and therefore what new grant is there greater then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that we may not have from him, if we ſeek it of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He treads never a ſtep, but <hi>that</hi> that is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:136185:100"/>
                     <hi>paved</hi> with mercy: <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy to them that fear him, and to them that keep his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. His <hi>paths</hi> that he comes in towards us in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> in his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> they are all beſet and beſpread with <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and therefore what <hi>new mercy</hi> it is that we would have, and what more then formerly we have had for our ſelves or others, he is willing to give in to us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hath <hi>commanded</hi> us not to <hi>withhold from others that which is their due, when it is in the power of our hand to do it,</hi> Prov. 3.27. and if ſo, then ſure he will not withhold any thing from us, if we ſeek it of him, though it be <hi>new,</hi> ſeeing it is in the power of his hand to do it. He would not be out-bidden and out-vied by man; he would not fall ſhort (in a way of kindneſs and goodneſs) of any of the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is <hi>a God hearing prayer,</hi> Pſal. 65.2. he is alwayes at it. Other Princes have their times appointed to hear their Suiters, their <hi>ſet times</hi> and <hi>dayes of audience</hi> to hear Ambaſſadors; but God is <hi>alwayes</hi> hearing his Suiters: and be it that our Prayers be the <hi>Souls Ambaſſadors,</hi> yet he puts them not off, but is <hi>alwayes hearing;</hi> and therefore what <hi>new Requeſts</hi> we come with, we may get a grant from him of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From his believing Suppliants:</hi> 1. They are his <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> he is <hi>King of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:136185:101"/>Saints,</hi> Rev. 15.3. and Loyal and faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may get their Grants renewed, much more may his.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>his Servants,</hi> Pſal. 116.16. and Servants of Princes, ſuch as they are that are of the Bed-chamber, as they are <hi>wiſe</hi> to take their time to renew their ſuits, ſo they have the Kings ear, and a new Grant <hi>ſigned</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> to them: and ſhall the Servants of God fare worſe then the Servants of Princes? Surely no.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are in <hi>favour with him,</hi> and <hi>accepted of him,</hi> Eph. 1.6. and what new Grants have not they that are in favour with Princes? and ſhall not we much rather that are in favour with God? <hi>Brutus</hi> with <hi>Julius, Mecenas</hi> with <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, Sejanus</hi> with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> what might they not have had of theſe <hi>great ones?</hi> and if ſo, what new grants may not the Saints have of him that <hi>hath made us accepted in the beloved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>his Friends,</hi> Jam. 2.23. and any friend will get a <hi>new grant,</hi> and have more for <hi>asking:</hi> what can God <hi>deny us</hi> then that ſeek for <hi>new favours,</hi> and <hi>new grants</hi> from him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>his Followers,</hi> Eph. 5.1. they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in his Virtues and Excellencies, and ſuch may have any thing of him. <hi>Similitude</hi> works us up to the height: we love thoſe that <hi>reſemble us,</hi> ſo does God; and we may have what we will of him, if we be <hi>like to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:136185:101"/>
                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the renewed grants themſelves.</hi> 1. They are <hi>eaſily made by him,</hi> it is as eaſie with him to give <hi>more</hi> as <hi>leſs,</hi> to renew <hi>twenty</hi> as well as one: He can do <hi>every thing,</hi> Job 42.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>quickly</hi> and <hi>ſpeedily done;</hi> they are ſometimes <hi>granted</hi> before they are <hi>asked,</hi> Iſa. 65.24. Dan. 9.23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>cordially given in,</hi> with all his <hi>heart,</hi> and with all his <hi>ſoul,</hi> Jer. 32.40, 41. and what ſhould hinder their coming in then to us?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They tend to <hi>his honour;</hi> he hath the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them given to him, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.23. he hath <hi>new ſongs</hi> for his <hi>new mercies,</hi> Pſal. 40.3.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They binde us to <hi>duty and obedience.</hi> New Grants made by Princes, oblige the Subjects to duty and obedience: ſo theſe grants from God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are greatly <hi>indearing</hi> our hearts to God. Princes by their liberality endear their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to them; ſo does God: His <hi>love to us,</hi> begets our <hi>love to him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.19. It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of King <hi>James,</hi> That he bound thoſe he loved unto him, by granting them ſome <hi>Requeſt</hi> that they made ſuit for, which he thought bound their love to him: ſo does God by his grants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear our hearts to him.</p>

He is a rich Prince, and ſo full of royalty, that he will give us our asking, though we deſire more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.

                  <p n="2">2. We ſee what great <hi>encouragements</hi> we have to <hi>renew our ſuits,</hi> and to ask more; for God is willing to renew his grants as we do our ſuits, and if we would have ſomething more then we deſired at firſt, he is very willing to come off to us, and to give us more. Would any Prince on earth ſo do, his Court would be full of ſuiters, they would preſs in for <hi>audience,</hi> and fill his doors, and be much encouraged to come: Oh how full of ſuiters ſhould the Court of Heaven then be, and what encouragement ſhould they take to <hi>ask more,</hi> and to come with <hi>new ſuits,</hi> that have ſuch a God to go to that will <hi>give more</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we ask, and <hi>renew grants</hi> as we do our ſuits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.3.</p>

                  <p n="4">4.

                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>Abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Exod. 34.6. the whole Earth is <hi>full of it,</hi> Pſal. 119.64. and this Believers <hi>know,</hi> and that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:136185:104"/>makes them inceſſant in their ſuing to him, and after his <hi>renewed grants,</hi> to follow him with ſuits again and again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>a Sun,</hi> Pſal. 84.11.

                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>hath not ſtinted us,</hi> nor put any <hi>bounds</hi> to our lawful deſires, but hath bidden us <hi>ask what we will,</hi> and <hi>as often as we will,</hi> to ask <hi>great things,</hi> and <hi>many things,</hi> Jer. 33.3.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath promiſed, that <hi>we ſhall have all we ask according to his will,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.14, 15. and therefore we may well go <hi>again</hi> and <hi>again to him,</hi> and not give over, though we have got our <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſuits</hi> granted to us. Princes promiſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Subjects <hi>Addreſſes</hi> to them; as we ſee in the Promiſes of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> to <hi>Eſther,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> to his <hi>Dancing Minion:</hi> how much more then will <hi>Gods promiſes</hi> encourage us in our <hi>prayers to him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:136185:105"/>
                  <p n="5">5. He deſires to <hi>hear us ſpeaking to him,</hi> Cant. 2.14. <hi>Let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice:</hi> and if he deſire <hi>this,</hi> we may well be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to come again. We may well let him have <hi>his deſire,</hi> that lets us <hi>have ours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He takes <hi>pleaſure</hi> in our <hi>often coming,</hi> Cant. 2.14. <hi>Sweet is thy voice:</hi> Our Prayers are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and melody in his ears. Hence alſo the Prayers of Believers are compared to <hi>Incenſe,</hi> Pſal. 141.2. and that had a fragrant ſweet ſmell: Such are Believers Prayers, they are <hi>ſweet-ſcented, fragrant,</hi> ſavour well in his noſthrils, they are <hi>delightſome to him;</hi> and this may well put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to <hi>follow him</hi> with our ſuits, that are ſo <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From Believers.</hi> 1. They are and may be <hi>bold with God,</hi> (as I ſaid before) and from that <hi>holy boldneſs</hi> do go again and again to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. They that <hi>have leave</hi> to be bold with Kings, as Favourites have, may go as oft as they will to them; and though they have got <hi>their renewed grants,</hi> yet they will come again: ſo it is with Believers that are in favour with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though they have <hi>many deſires granted,</hi> and <hi>many of their ſuits hearkned to,</hi> yet their wants are <hi>many</hi> ſtill, and will be while they are in this world; and if ſome be ſupplied, yet they need more, and therefore cannot but come again. We are made up of wants; and when we have got
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:136185:105"/>
                     <hi>ſomething,</hi> we need <hi>more;</hi> when <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour hath been brought in to us, ſtill we are lacking ſomething further, and therefore cannot but go to him again for ſupplies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They know they go to <hi>a liberal one,</hi> that <hi>gives to all liberally,</hi> Jam. 1.5. and therefore though they have received <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>other benefit</hi> from him, yet if they ſpeak yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and <hi>ask on,</hi> he will not <hi>deny them:</hi> and this puts them on to ſue for further favour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They do not uſe to <hi>deny their friends</hi> that ſue to <hi>them,</hi> though they <hi>come often;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but judge that they fall <hi>infinitely ſhort</hi> of God, <hi>who is rich in mercy,</hi> Eph. 2.4. and this puts them upon it to go often to <hi>the Throne of Grace,</hi> and again and again to ask for further favour, though they have prevailed in their ſuits before.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They have <hi>engaged themſelves to call upon God as long as they live,</hi> Pſal. 116.2. and this <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of theirs puts them upon it to make <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent addreſſes</hi> to him; and though they have got their deſires in <hi>ſome things,</hi> yet they cannot there make a <hi>ſtop,</hi> but muſt ask further, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> here did.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are the <hi>more welcome,</hi> the oftner they come, and the more ſuits they bring. Some men will ſay to their friends, That <hi>the oftner they come, the more welcome they be;</hi> and ſome ſay it <hi>feignedly,</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:136185:106"/>and others in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality:</hi> but however it is with men, it is ſo with God, he is <hi>beſt pleaſed with us</hi> when we are moſt frequently with him, we are moſt welcome to him, when he hears us oftneſt with him. It's ſaid of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that <hi>walked conſtantly with God,</hi> Gen. 5.22. and followed his ſuits hard, that <hi>he had this teſtimony, that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God,</hi> Heb. 11.5. and ſo it is with them that <hi>come again,</hi> they are <hi>welcome,</hi> and that puts them upon coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are <hi>reſtleſs</hi> in their motions towards the Lord; they are like the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> that cannot ſtand ſtill: Though they have <hi>got much</hi> at the Lords hands by bringing their ſuits <hi>before him,</hi> yet they <hi>cannot reſt there,</hi> but muſt try the Lord yet further, and get <hi>ſomething more;</hi> their Suits muſt <hi>go on,</hi> their Prayers muſt not have <hi>bounds</hi> ſet to them, but when new grants have been made, yet they muſt pray further, and ſpeak <hi>yet again,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here did. That man that ceaſeth Prayer, though he <hi>hath got much,</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in <hi>the ſteps of the faith of Abraham,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>keeps not pace with him</hi> in a way believing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that Believers have <hi>great intereſt in God,</hi> for they make <hi>many ſuits to him;</hi> yea, when they have <hi>got much,</hi> yet cannot ſtop there, but will <hi>ask for more,</hi> and try the Lord for <hi>more grace</hi> be given in to them. Great is their intereſt in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:136185:106"/>Princes that can do ſo, and ſuch and much more is Believers intereſt in the Lord: God is <hi>theirs,</hi> and therefore they are emboldened to ask ſo much of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.94. &amp; 118.28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that they that <hi>ſit ſtill,</hi> and quiet themſelves in <hi>grace received,</hi> and do not <hi>come again</hi> as need is, but <hi>reſtrain prayer, as they caſt off fear,</hi> Job 15.4. ſo they are not of <hi>the faith of Abraham,</hi> for though he had ſuit after ſuit <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> yet he <hi>ſued ſtill,</hi> and ſpake <hi>yet again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that a Believers <hi>reſtleſs motion</hi> in praying, comes near <hi>Angelical work;</hi> for, the <hi>Angels ceaſe not night nor day in praiſing God,</hi> Rev. 4. and Believers here ceaſe not to <hi>call upon God;</hi> and though they <hi>have obtained much,</hi> yet they <hi>reſt not there,</hi> but muſt have more: and who would not be like <hi>the Angels?</hi> who would not follow thoſe <hi>Celeſtial Spirits?</hi> it is a rare thing to imitate thoſe glorious <hi>Heroes,</hi> and to ſerve our <hi>King</hi> like thoſe noble Courtiers that <hi>wait continually upon him,</hi> and <hi>alwayes behold his face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee what <hi>longing deſires</hi> we ſhould have to be in Heaven, where we ſhall be alwayes in his Preſence, and never ceaſe <hi>ſerving of him,</hi> Rev. 22.3, 4. Here we do <hi>ſomething</hi> like the ſervice of God <hi>there,</hi> in that we <hi>ceaſe not our ſuits to him;</hi> onely here is the difference, that what we do <hi>here</hi> is <hi>imperfect ſervice,</hi> and we have our <hi>clogs</hi> and <hi>hindrances</hi> in what we <hi>beſt do,</hi> but in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:136185:107"/>we ſhall be more <hi>conſtant,</hi> ſo we ſhall never be <hi>interrupted</hi> in our ſervice, nor have any <hi>clog</hi> or <hi>hindrance</hi> at all: and therefore we ſhould <hi>long</hi> for that <hi>bleſſed place,</hi> where we ſhall have <hi>reſtleſs motions</hi> in what we do for him <hi>there,</hi> and ſhall never ceaſe ſerving him with all our ſtrength and might.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee that Faith is <hi>an active grace,</hi> it is upon the <hi>wing,</hi> it is upon the <hi>ſuit for,</hi> and <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of grace</hi> and <hi>mercy:</hi> though it hath <hi>got much,</hi> yet it is ſtill buſie, and ſlacks not its pace, but haſtes to the <hi>Kings Court</hi> to make more <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,</hi> to preſent more <hi>ſupplications at the Throne of Grace.</hi> It is an <hi>operative grace,</hi> its never <hi>idle,</hi> but ever at work, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Remembring your work of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee that Believers are <hi>the praying men,</hi> and are the moſt inceſſant in that duty. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may call upon God for a time, but they will ſoon give out; <hi>Will he alwayes call upon God?</hi> ſayes <hi>Job,</hi> Job 27.10. but ſound Believers <hi>hold out</hi> in Prayer, and when they have been heard, God ſhall hear of them again, and they have ſomething to ſay further to him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here, that <hi>ſpake yet again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee that the Lord <hi>condeſcends very much</hi> to Believers, that gives them leave to come ſo frequently into his Preſence, and to bring ſuit after ſuit before him: This is not the manner
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:136185:107"/>of men, this is not the manner of Princes, but God does thus, and there's none <hi>like to him,</hi> in ſo <hi>humbling himſelf</hi> in admitting us to come ſo often into his Preſence to ask more of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.5, 6.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>delighteth in our prayers,</hi> Prov. 15.8. and how then can he be weary to grant our requeſts
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:136185:109"/>which he <hi>delights in.</hi> There may be a kinde of <hi>wearineſs</hi> attending other <hi>delights of ſinful men,</hi> but what the holy God <hi>delights in,</hi> he cannot be weary of.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is a <hi>great King,</hi> Pſal. 47.2. Mal. 1.14. and ſhews himſelf <hi>like himſelf,</hi> and <hi>like a King:</hi> and as other Kings are unwearied in granting what their Favourites ſue for, how often ſoever they come, and how much ſoever they ask: ſo it is with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>commands</hi> us to be <hi>unwearied in giving,</hi> Mat. 5.42. Luke 6.30. and this <hi>latter place,</hi> that it muſt be <hi>to every man that asks,</hi> holds out <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedneſs in giving:</hi> and he that layes this charge upon us, that we ſhould <hi>not be weary</hi> of this, ſurely he muſt needs be much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied himſelf in giving grants to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From Believers.</hi> 1. They are not <hi>weary of asking,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here; and how then can he be <hi>weary of granting?</hi> We may wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſome men this way, but not God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are ſome of them <hi>unwearied in giving;</hi> as it is ſaid of Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> That <hi>he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied any that asked for Jeſus ſake.</hi> And if among men there be found <hi>ſome</hi> that are unwearied in <hi>giving,</hi> then much more is it true of the Lord, <hi>That he is unwearied in granting the Requeſts of his believing Suppliants, how often ſoever they pray to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:136185:109"/>
                  <p n="3">3. They ask nothing but that which is <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will,</hi> and they that ſo ask are ever heard, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14, 15. God is never weary of ſuch men, nor of their Prayers, come they as oft as they will to ſue to him. If the <hi>Kings will</hi> be in the Petitions that are put up to him, he will not be tired out with ſuch Petitions, though fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſented to him: So here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They <hi>ask in faith,</hi> and faith will carry all before it. God will be unwearied in granting what we ask in faith. They <hi>that doubt,</hi> get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7. but they that <hi>pray in faith,</hi> every thing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22. let them come as often as they will they ſhall be heard: God will not be weary of them, nor of their ſuits.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They pray <hi>fervently,</hi> and <hi>fervent prayers avail much,</hi> Jam. 5.16. Earneſt ſuiters are ever ſpeeders with men, much more with the Lord; he cannot tell how to turn them off, or to be weary of them that <hi>pray earneſtly,</hi> though fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bringing ſuit after ſuit before him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They pray <hi>ſincerely,</hi> Pſal. 17.1. their heart goes with their lips, and he takes <hi>pleaſure in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.17. Even good men <hi>delight in uprightneſs,</hi> how much more the Lord? and therefore he cannot be weary of ſuch Prayers, but muſt needs grant them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>pure prayers;</hi> ſo were <hi>Abrahams</hi> here: ſo <hi>Job</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:136185:110"/>ſayes, <hi>My prayer is pure,</hi> Job 16.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>pleaſant</hi> Prayers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. and how ſhould the Lord then be weary of them? He took pleaſure in <hi>Abrahams</hi> frequent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſuits, and therefore could not deny a grant to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>humble</hi> Prayers. <hi>Abraham</hi> all along, though <hi>bold</hi> in his ſuits, yet was very <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and God takes it well to ſee us <hi>humble</hi> when we pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>zealous</hi> Prayers: ſo were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> here; and this <hi>holy fire</hi> ever aſcends and prevails, when our Prayers are offered up with it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.37.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>argumentative</hi> Prayers, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> were; and God is pleaſed when we argue the caſe with him in Prayer. So did the <hi>woman of Canaan,</hi> and got what ſhe would.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>inwrought</hi> Prayers, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. ſuch were <hi>Abrahams</hi> here; he did not <hi>word it</hi> with God, but what requeſts he made were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,</hi> and came from the heart, and God was not weary of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee what great <hi>encouragement</hi> we have to come with <hi>ſuit upon ſuit</hi> before the Lord, for he is <hi>unwearied</hi> in granting the requeſts of his <hi>believing Suppliants,</hi> how often ſoever they make their addreſſes to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. So it is with them that come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:136185:110"/>gracious Princes, when they finde them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grant what they ſue for, and are not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with their Requeſts that they put up to them, they will come <hi>again</hi> and <hi>again,</hi> and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon their Clemency, and bring <hi>ſuit upon ſuit,</hi> and are encouraged to follow them with their ſupplications: ſo it ſhould be with us in our ſuits to a gracious God, we cannot <hi>tire him out,</hi> but he is <hi>unwearied</hi> in giving out grants to us</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee what cauſe we have <hi>not to be weary of well-doing,</hi> Gal. 6.9. for if he be <hi>unwearied</hi> in granting our deſires, it were a ſhame for us to be <hi>weary</hi> of what he would have us do for him in ſuch a way. We are apt to be weary of any thing that is good, and are ſoon tired out, but Gods <hi>unweariedneſs</hi> in doing for us, ſhould make us bluſh when we are <hi>weary</hi> of that wherewith we may ſerve him, or do good to others for his ſake.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee how <hi>happy</hi> the ſtate of the <hi>bleſſed Angels</hi> are, that as they never yet <hi>trod a wry ſtep,</hi> but have been conſtant and unwearied in a way of obedience; ſo they ſhall keep an <hi>unwearied courſe</hi> therein to all Eternity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20, 21. God hath been unwearied in his <hi>favour</hi> to them, and they are unwearied in their <hi>duty</hi> to him, and this is their height of Happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee what <hi>longings</hi> we ſhould have after <hi>that time,</hi> when we ſhall be unwearied in our <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> to him. Here we are ſoon weary
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:136185:111"/>and tired out with what he calls for, and tread many a wry ſtep in what we do in way of duty to him; but when we come in <hi>Heaven,</hi> we ſhall never be weary more, but ſhall <hi>praiſe,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him to all Eternity. This ſtate we ſhould <hi>long for,</hi> and be weary of our wearineſs in our duties here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee what our duty is, to <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>follow him</hi> in being unwearied in anſwering the deſires of his poor ones that ſue to us: though they ſhould come <hi>often</hi> to us, and bring <hi>one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt after another</hi> to us, if it be <hi>in the power of our hand,</hi> we are to take pattern by the Lord himſelf, and not to turn away our ears from their cries, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.27, 28.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee how <hi>unworthy we ſhould count our ſelves</hi> of ſuch a mercy as this is, that God ſhould be ſo unwearied in granting the Requeſts of his poor ones: Who are we, that <hi>we</hi> ſhould bring <hi>ſuit upon ſuit</hi> before him, and have <hi>all granted?</hi> This ſhould lay us <hi>low</hi> before him, and we ſhould judge our ſelves (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did) <hi>leſs then the leaſt of all his mercies,</hi> Gen. 32.10.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee what cauſe Believers have to <hi>exalt Grace,</hi> that goes on in an <hi>unwearied courſe</hi> and way of <hi>granting</hi> what we ſue unto him for. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Earth, Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> may ſay, <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> for this. What <hi>loud acclamations</hi> are made to Princes by their People when they make <hi>great
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:136185:111"/>Grants</hi> to them? Oh what <hi>ſhoutings,</hi> and <hi>loud acclamations</hi> then ſhould we make for this <hi>great Grace</hi> of his towards us? See for illuſtration of this, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.7. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.6.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee what <hi>height of praiſe</hi> we ſhall come off with in another world, for theſe <hi>large grants</hi> made to us here. Here we do <hi>a little,</hi> but we do but <hi>bungle</hi> at this duty of <hi>praiſe;</hi> here we can <hi>cry like children</hi> for what we want, but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we ſhall be <hi>men,</hi> and perform our duty of <hi>praiſe</hi> to purpoſe: There Songs will be in our <hi>mouthes and hearts,</hi> and <hi>new Songs of praiſe.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. To be <hi>unwearied in our praiſes to him,</hi> we can never do it <hi>enough,</hi> nor long <hi>enough,</hi> till the

                  <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>How does it appear that they are afraid of God being angry with their prayers?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In regard of themſelves. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In regard of themſelves.</hi> 1. In that they think they may be <hi>too bold with him,</hi> and preſs <hi>too much upon him:</hi> ſo did <hi>Abraham</hi> here, and ſo did <hi>Gideon</hi> in the place before-mentioned. They that Petition to Princes, are ſometimes ſo bold, that they think they may be over-bold with them, and ſo incurre their diſpleaſure: ſo it is with them that petition to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>vile,</hi> and God <hi>a glorious One,</hi> and therefore that they ſhould come ſo often into his preſence, and follow him ſo with ſuit upon ſuit, they may well <hi>fear</hi> that ſuch a glorious One may be angry at ſuch <hi>vile ones</hi> as they are. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo <hi>Job</hi> looked at themſelves, and ſo every <hi>believing humble ſuppliant</hi> does, and ought to think.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:136185:113"/>
                  <p n="3">3. In that they would keep that <hi>due diſtance</hi> that is between God and them, and therefore they are <hi>afraid</hi> that he may be angry that that <hi>diſtance</hi> hath not been obſerved. The truth is, though Princes and Subjects have this kept, yet we are not ſo careful to obſerve it when we <hi>draw near</hi> to the Lord. Little do we think <hi>who God is</hi> that we have to do with, and who <hi>we are</hi> that come before him: now Believers are ſenſible of this, and ſo are afraid that God may be angry with their Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that they deſire <hi>pardon</hi> for their prayers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.19. and therefore are <hi>afraid</hi> he may be angry with their Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In that they <hi>confeſs the ſins</hi> of their prayers, Pſal. 130.3. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldſt mark iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> if in our <hi>beſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> God ſhould mark our failings and ſins, there would be no <hi>ſtanding</hi> before him, he might well be angry with them. See <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.15.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In that they <hi>finde it ſo,</hi> and expoſtulate with God about it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4. God can be <hi>angry,</hi> and <hi>long angry at the prayers of his people:</hi> and what he is to <hi>ſome of them,</hi> he may be to <hi>any of them,</hi> and the beſt believers may be afraid of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In regard of their Prayers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>defiled,</hi> and need <hi>waſhing</hi> in Chriſts Blood: and being <hi>ſo defiled,</hi> they may well be afraid that God may be angry with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. The
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:136185:113"/>righteouſneſs of our <hi>beſt performances,</hi> as well as of our <hi>perſons,</hi> is <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> no menſtruous Clout is more defiled then our Prayers are, as they come from us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>full of wandrings,</hi> our hearts are <hi>unfixed</hi> in the duty of Prayer. There are many roving <hi>thoughts</hi> that we are hurried and carried about with, that marre the duty, if God paſs them not by, and we may well fear that God may be angry for them. <hi>David</hi> had <hi>a fixed heart,</hi> Pſal. 57.7. but ours too often <hi>gad abroad.</hi> What is ſaid of the <hi>Adultereſs,</hi> may be ſaid of our <hi>adulterous hearts:</hi> now it is ſaid of her, Prov. 7.11, 12. <hi>Her feet abide not in her houſe, now ſhe is without, now in the ſtrects, and lieth in wait at every conner.</hi> So it is true of us when we come before the Lord in Prayer; our falſe hearts abide not cloſe to the duty, but now they are <hi>without,</hi> now in the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> and lye in wait to <hi>deceive us</hi> at every corner of the world, thinking of <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>other vain things;</hi> yea, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of theſe <hi>flies</hi> (if we watch not in Prayer) will be buzzing about us, and carry us away from God and the duty, from one <hi>England</hi> to another, and into all the corners of the world: and this may well make us afraid that God will be angry at our Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are not <hi>ſerious</hi> Prayers, nor we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and upright in them: the <hi>duty</hi> it ſelf is a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:136185:114"/>ſerious duty, and God is ſerious with us in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it,</hi> but we are apt to trifle with him in it, and rather to ſport and play with the duty, and to <hi>word it</hi> with God, then to expreſs any ſeriouſneſs at all in it: the <hi>heart</hi> is gone <hi>far from God,</hi> when the <hi>lips are near him,</hi> Mat. 15.8. theſe are hypocritical Prayers, and they that offer them up, Hypocrites, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Now Believers Prayers have a <hi>tang</hi> of hypocriſie in them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and therefore they may fear that God may be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are not ſo <hi>earneſt</hi> and <hi>fervent</hi> Prayers as God calls for, they are not ſo <hi>heated</hi> with the fire of the Spirit as God expects, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. though this cannot be ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> yet of many that go for Believers it may, that are <hi>dull,</hi> and <hi>heavy,</hi> and <hi>ſleepy</hi> in Prayer, as the Diſciples of Chriſt ſometimes were, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39, 40. now may they well then fear that ſuch Prayers God may be angry with. A Prince would be angry with a <hi>cold Suit;</hi> ſo God with <hi>cold</hi> Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>angry</hi> Prayers, <hi>paſſionate</hi> Prayers, have too much <hi>wilde-fire</hi> in them: So had <hi>Jonah</hi> when he prayed, he rather <hi>vented his paſſion,</hi> then prayed, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. and threw out words in his <hi>heat</hi> againſt the Lord. So <hi>Elijah</hi> cannot be excuſed from <hi>too much heat,</hi> and therefore <hi>James</hi> calls him <hi>a paſſionate man,</hi> Jam. 5.17. So <hi>James</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:136185:114"/>and <hi>John</hi> had too much <hi>heat of ſpirit,</hi> Luke 9.54. and ſo others have had: now ſuch fire of our <hi>own kindling</hi> God no way approves of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saints may well fear that he may be angry with ſuch <hi>angry</hi> Prayers. Would not a King be angry if a Petitioner ſhould be <hi>paſſionate with him</hi> that ſues unto him? So here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are ſometimes <hi>unconſtant</hi> Prayers, they are but <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then</hi> performed; God hears of us but <hi>ſeldome,</hi> or it may be when we are in <hi>affliction,</hi> Iſa. 26.16. Hoſ. 5.15. and may we not then fear that God will be angry with ſuch Prayers? Will not a father be angry when his children come ſeldome into his ſight to ask what they ſtand in need of? ſo will God; and therefore we may well fear that he will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with ſuch Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Why are Believers afraid that God may be angry with their Prayers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. From God. 2. From our ſelves that pray.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From God.</hi> 1. He <hi>ſees that</hi> in our Prayers that we <hi>cannot ſee</hi> our ſelves: He <hi>ſees ſin,</hi> where we <hi>ſee none;</hi> he hath a <hi>quick eye</hi> to look into the <hi>obliquities</hi> and <hi>iniquities</hi> of our Prayers. A little blemiſh is ſeen in the <hi>face;</hi> ſo if there be but any <hi>blot</hi> or <hi>ſpot</hi> upon the face of the <hi>duty,</hi> his <hi>pure eyes</hi> ſpies it out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.20, 21. there is not the <hi>leaſt mote</hi> but he takes notice of,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:136185:115"/>not the <hi>leaſt ſpot</hi> but his eye is upon, and that wherein we think we <hi>do well,</hi> he knows to be <hi>evil. James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> thought they did well, in deſiring that <hi>they</hi> might do as <hi>Elias</hi> did, to <hi>call for fire from heaven</hi> to conſume thoſe that would not <hi>receive their Maſter</hi> and ours: but what ſayes he to them? <hi>Ye know not what ſpirit you are of:</hi> He ſaw that that they thought <hi>zeal,</hi> to be <hi>wilde-fire;</hi> he knew that that which they judged to come from <hi>love to their dear Maſter,</hi> was but <hi>a ſpark of their own kindling,</hi> and no <hi>love</hi> in the bottom of it, neither to Chriſt nor themſelves, much leſs to thoſe men that they wiſhed ſo ill to. And may not Believers be juſtly afraid that God will be angry with ſuch Prayers?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath been angry with the Prayers of <hi>others,</hi> and <hi>long angry,</hi> Pſal. 80.4. and therefore they fear he may be angry with <hi>their prayers.</hi> When Princes are angry with ſome that ſue to them, others are afraid that they may be angry with their ſuits alſo: ſo it is in this caſe between God and us. If a father be angry with ſome of his Children, he may be angry upon the like grounds with the reſt: ſo may God, and that may make the reſt to fear that he may be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>withdraws himſelf</hi> ſometimes from his people when they pray to him, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8, 44. and thats a <hi>ground</hi> of his being <hi>angry</hi> at their <hi>prayers;</hi>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:136185:115"/>and this makes them afraid that he is angry with them. <hi>Job</hi> complained of this, <hi>Job</hi> 30.20. <hi>I cry unto thee, and thou doſt not hear me: I ſtand up, and thou regardeſt me not.</hi> When a Prince <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws</hi> from a Suppliant, and <hi>regards him not,</hi> it is a ſign of his anger, and he fears he is diſpleaſed with him: ſo it is in this caſe between God and us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He ſees that we too often <hi>reſtrain prayer before him,</hi> and thereby <hi>caſt off fear,</hi> Job 15.4. and that makes him angry: and when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, that makes us afraid that he is angry with our Prayers that we are ſo <hi>ſlack in. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſayes, <hi>As vineger to the teeth, and ſmoke to the eyes, ſo is a ſlothful meſſenger to him that ſends him.</hi> If our Prayers, which are the <hi>Souls meſſengers,</hi> be <hi>ſlothful,</hi> and we <hi>ſlack our pace</hi> in them, God will be diſpleaſed, and we may well fear that he will be angry with them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From our ſelves that pray.</hi> 1. We ſometimes <hi>diſtruſt Gods power,</hi> and that makes him angry, and makes us afraid that he is angry with our Prayers: <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.22. he doubted of <hi>Chriſts power to heal his ſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſometimes <hi>diſtruſt his will,</hi> as the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per did,</hi> though he did <hi>believe his power,</hi> Mat. 8.2. and that is a juſt ground of his anger, and <hi>that</hi> that makes us afraid that he may be angry with our Prayers.</p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:136185:116"/>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſometimes ask <hi>that</hi> that God reſolves he will <hi>never give:</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> did, that deſired God that he might <hi>go over Jordan, and ſee that good Land;</hi> which God was angry with him for, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.25, 26. Two things hindred the granting of his deſire: 1. God was <hi>provoked at the Waters of Strife,</hi> and threatned <hi>he ſhould not bring his people into that Land,</hi> Numb. 20.12, 2. He appointed <hi>Joſhua</hi> to be the man; wherein was a <hi>myſtery,</hi> for he was a Type of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that brings us into <hi>Heaven,</hi> that <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type of. Now for <hi>Moſes</hi> to deſire <hi>that,</hi> that God upon ſuch juſt grounds <hi>denied,</hi> it could not but diſpleaſe him, and make him angry: and ſo may we well fear that God will be angry with our Prayers, when we deſire that of him that he is reſolved not to give us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We deſire that ſometimes that is <hi>not good for us,</hi> and that will make God angry with our Prayers; for <hi>no good thing he will withhold from us,</hi> Pſal. 14.11. and 34.10. but if we ask any thing <hi>that is not good for us,</hi> and he ſees it will <hi>hurt us,</hi> rather then <hi>do us good,</hi> he will be angry with our Prayers. Thus for <hi>Jonah</hi> to deſire <hi>once</hi> and <hi>again</hi> that God would <hi>take away his life from him,</hi> Jonah 4.3, 8. which could not be <hi>good for him,</hi> could not but diſpleaſe him: and when we ask that which is not <hi>good for us,</hi> we have ground to fear that he will be angry with our Prayers.</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:136185:116"/>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſometimes deſire <hi>that</hi> that will be <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to others;</hi> as it would have been to the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevites,</hi> if <hi>Jonah</hi> had had <hi>that</hi> that he deſired, for then they had all been deſtroyed. So <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> if they had had their deſire, what would have become of thoſe <hi>non-entertainers of Chriſt? Luke</hi> 9. and if we do ſo, and deſire <hi>the hurt of others,</hi> may we not juſtly be afraid that God will be angry with our Prayers?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They ſometimes deſire <hi>that</hi> that may be <hi>ſatisfaction to their own luſts,</hi> as <hi>Jonah</hi> deſired <hi>Ninevehs deſtruction,</hi> rather then that they ſhould be <hi>ſpared</hi> upon their repentance, becauſe <hi>his Credit lay at the ſtake,</hi> having denounced the overthrow of it <hi>within forty dayes.</hi> Here the <hi>luſt of Pride</hi> was too predominant in the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.1. and can we wonder that God ſhould be angry with ſuch Prayers? Pride ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in to ſuch a <hi>duty,</hi> marres the <hi>duty,</hi> and makes God angry. Thus many will pray againſt ſuch and ſuch men, wherein they vent their <hi>pride and paſſion,</hi> and how can God be pleaſed with ſuch Prayers? they may well fear he will be angry with them. If a man ſhould be proud before a Prince, when he comes to Petition to him, would not the Prince be angry with ſuch Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? So here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee that there is no cauſe for us to <hi>glory in our prayers</hi> that we
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:136185:117"/>bring before the Lord; for if we look ſeriouſly into them, we may ſee cauſe to <hi>fear</hi> that God may juſtly be angry with them: or if we our ſelves ſhould not ſee ſuch cauſe, yet <hi>Gods pure eye</hi> cannot but <hi>ſee enough</hi> in the beſt Prayers we make, for which he may be <hi>diſpleaſed with us.</hi> There would be <hi>no ſtanding,</hi> if <hi>he ſhould mark what we do amiſs</hi> when we pray to him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 130.3. there will be <hi>ſome blot</hi> cleaving to the <hi>beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> we preſent him; the <hi>beſt fire</hi> will bring <hi>ſome ſmoke</hi> and <hi>ſoot;</hi> and when our Prayers are <hi>moſt fervent</hi> with the <hi>fire of the Spirit,</hi> they have <hi>ſome defilement,</hi> like <hi>ſoot</hi> and <hi>ſmoke,</hi> that comes from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee how <hi>humble</hi> we ſhould be, and how <hi>low</hi> we ſhould lye before the Lord, both <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pray,</hi> and <hi>in prayer,</hi> and <hi>after we have done the duty,</hi> for we may well fear that ſomething <hi>may come,</hi> or <hi>hath come</hi> from us, for which God may be angry with our Prayers; and when God hath any occaſion given him to be angry, we have cauſe to fall down humbly before him. When a King is juſtly angry, the Subject ſtoops, and abaſeth himſelf; if a Father be angry, all the Children carry themſelves ſubmiſſively: ſo ſhould we. It is ſaid of <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>when he was angry</hi> (as he often was) <hi>the chief Peers of his Kingdome would ſtoop humbly to him;</hi> how much more ſhould we <hi>ſtoop
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:136185:117"/>humbly</hi> to the Lord when he is angry at our Prayers, who is <hi>the great King over all the earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee the truth of that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. <hi>When I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> When we go to <hi>pray,</hi> it is <hi>good that we do,</hi> and a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duty;</hi> but even then <hi>evil is preſent with us,</hi> and we have cauſe to fear that ſomething <hi>may</hi> or <hi>hath broken from us</hi> in the <hi>duty,</hi> for which God may be angry with us. When a man thinks to go a <hi>right ſtep,</hi> he takes a <hi>wry ſtep,</hi> that makes him ſtumble and fall: when a man would give a <hi>right ſtroke,</hi> his inſtrument ſometimes <hi>ſlips,</hi> and the <hi>ſtroke is wrong:</hi> when a man would make <hi>good muſick,</hi> a <hi>String</hi> breaks, or a <hi>Pegge</hi> ſlips, and makes <hi>an harſh ſound.</hi> So it is when we <hi>pray,</hi> and would tread right in the duty, and ſtrike a right ſtroke, and make a pleaſant ſound like melody in the Lords ears, then we tread awry, and ſtrike amiſs, and make ſuch an harſh ſound, that God is not delighted, but angry with our Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that if we be afraid that God may be <hi>angry</hi> with our Prayers, what cauſe then have we to fear that he will be angry with us for our <hi>other ſins</hi> that we do too often provoke him with? If he hath ſo much againſt us for our <hi>duties,</hi> Oh what hath he then againſt us for our <hi>other evils</hi> in <hi>thought, word</hi> and <hi>deed,</hi> whereby he is diſpleaſed! we ſhould be afraid that he will
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:136185:118"/>be angry for theſe. If he will be angry with <hi>wry ſteps</hi> and <hi>trips,</hi> Oh how angry will he be for <hi>deep falls,</hi> and <hi>great provocations;</hi> if for <hi>ſpots</hi> we may fear his diſpleaſure, how much more for <hi>fouler ſins?</hi> A Schoolmaſter, if he ſee a Scholars <hi>blots</hi> in writing, he will be angry; but if he ſee him <hi>blurre</hi> and <hi>blot</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>face,</hi> and <hi>foul his clothes,</hi> he will be much more angry: So we have cauſe to be afraid of his anger for <hi>groſſer evils,</hi> if he be angry at our Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee what cauſe we have to breathe after <hi>an immortal eſtate in glory,</hi> where neither we nor any of our ſervices ſhall have any <hi>blot</hi> or <hi>ſpot</hi> upon us or them. Here we are afraid that God may be angry at our Prayers, and that he may ſee juſt cauſe for it, our beſt duties being <hi>defiled;</hi> but when we come in Heaven, there will be no <hi>blot</hi> cleave to any of our ſervices, we ſhall give him no cauſe to be angry, nor ſhall we fear his anger to be expreſſed toward us. Here in our beſt duties <hi>we ſin,</hi> our beauty is <hi>ſtained,</hi> our face gathers <hi>blackneſs,</hi> we have ſomething of <hi>Ethiopian hue,</hi> ſome <hi>ſpots</hi> and <hi>ſpeaks</hi> are upon us, ſome <hi>wrinkles</hi> of the <hi>old man</hi> appear in the face of the beſt of our <hi>performances:</hi> but in Heaven we ſhall be faultleſs, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 4. <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> or any ſuch thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. nothing ſhall then be ſeen upon us like <hi>a ſpot,</hi> or like a <hi>wrinkle,</hi> all our <hi>imperfections</hi> will then be <hi>done

When <hi>Paul</hi> and his company were toſſed in the <hi>Adriatick Sea,</hi> and no ſmall tempeſt lay upon them, <hi>neither Sun nor Stars appearing for many dayes,</hi> and <hi>no hope left that they ſhould be ſaved,</hi> it's ſaid, that <hi>they wiſhed

                  <p n="6">6.

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee what need we have to <hi>get Chriſt to bear the iniquities of our holy things,</hi> as <hi>Aaron</hi> did in <hi>type</hi> of old: for the beſt of us may be afraid that God may be angry with our Prayers. Our <hi>holy things,</hi> even our <hi>pure prayers,</hi> have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>cleaving to them,</hi> that we may juſtly fear God is <hi>diſpleaſed with,</hi> and therefore great need we have of that <hi>great High Prieſt to bear</hi> (as all

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>VVE now come to the <hi>ſecond part</hi> of the <hi>Note,</hi> and that is this:
<q>That Believers deſire of God that he would not be angry with them when they pray to him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So did <hi>Abraham</hi> here, <hi>Let not the Lord be angry:</hi> So <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 6.39. <hi>Let not thine anger be hot againſt me.</hi> When we make Supplication to a Prince, we deſire this, that we may have the <hi>ſmiles of his face,</hi> and that he <hi>may not be angry
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:136185:121"/>with us:</hi> So do Believers when they make Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Lord, they do and ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Petitioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 2. From the nature of his anger.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Petitioners.</hi> 1. They deſire the <hi>acceptance</hi> of their Prayers, and that they may be <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>pleaſing to him;</hi> which they could not be, if God ſhould be angry with them. Pſal. 141.2. <hi>Let my prayer come before thee as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> Pſal. 10.14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They would be <hi>Princes with God,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.28. and this cannot be, if God be angry with them. A Prince will not be prevailed with, if he be <hi>angry with him</hi> that puts up his ſuit to him: So we ſhall never prevail with God, if he be angry with us when we pray to him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They ſee ſome juſt cauſe why <hi>he might be angry with them,</hi> if he ſhould be ſtrict with them, there are ſo many <hi>ſpots</hi> in the duty, and theſe they earneſtly deſire that he would not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of to be angry with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They are afraid that they are <hi>too bold with him,</hi> and therefore deſire that he would not be angry with them. So <hi>Abraham</hi> does here. When we ſue to men for ſome ſpecial favour, we deſire pardon for our <hi>boldneſs,</hi> as fearing that we may offend by it: ſo do they that make ſuit to the Lord.</p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:136185:121"/>
                     <p n="5">5. They are <hi>conſcious</hi> of their own integrity in the main, though they may have their failings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17, 18. and therefore deſire that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They <hi>expoſtulate</hi> with him in <hi>an humble way,</hi> about his anger with their Prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4. which ſhews that they ſee cauſe to deſire of God that he would not be angry with them: for ſuch an <hi>expoſtulation</hi> contains the force of an <hi>earneſt prayer,</hi> that he would withdraw his anger from them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>From the nature of his Anger.</hi> 1. It is like <hi>fire,</hi> and therefore <hi>Gideon</hi> expreſſeth it, Judg. 6.39. <hi>Let not thine anger be hot againſt me.</hi> Gods anger is as <hi>hot as fire;</hi> and therefore in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. it is ſaid, <hi>A fire is kindled in mine anger, that ſhall burn to the loweſt hell.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a <hi>fiery nature,</hi> it is not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at that they pray that God would not be angry with them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is like <hi>the dreadful waves of the Sea,</hi> Mic. 7.9. <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord:</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>indignation,</hi> ſignifies ſuch a raging as is in the <hi>raging waves of the Sea</hi> when they are lifted up on high, and threaten drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and overwhelming; and therefore <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.15. the ſame word is uſed for <hi>the raging of the Sea</hi> in a ſore ſtorm and tempeſt, and when the Sea <hi>rageth</hi> and is <hi>tempeſtuous,</hi> the Marriners ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:136185:122"/>deſire a Calm, and that they might be quiet, and the Sea might ceaſe from her raging. So Believers deſire of God, that the <hi>dreadful waves of the Sea of his anger</hi> may ceaſe, and that they may enjoy a quiet Calm.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is compared to <hi>ſmoke,</hi> Dent. 29.20. Pſal. 74.1. and <hi>ſmoke</hi> is a <hi>ſtifling thing,</hi> if it be in the extremity of it, and cannot be endured: and as men get out of a ſmoky houſe or room, as not being able to bear it, and deſire to be as farre from it as may be; ſo Believers deſire of God that the <hi>ſmoke of his anger</hi> may be removed from them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is ſet out to us under the notion of <hi>red wine</hi> that is <hi>full of mixture</hi> of that which doth <hi>intoxicate,</hi> Pſal. 75.8. and is <hi>without mixture</hi> of any thing that ſhould <hi>allay,</hi> and make it better to be endured, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10. ſo thoſe <hi>two places</hi> are reconciled. Now who would not deſire to be freed from ſuch a Cup of wine, that is ſo <hi>full of mixture</hi> to <hi>intoxicate</hi> and <hi>kill,</hi> and is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture</hi> of <hi>that</hi> that ſhould <hi>allay,</hi> and take away the <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> and <hi>deadly ſtrength</hi> of it? Such a Cup of wine is <hi>Gods anger,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Believers may well pray that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is compared to <hi>wormwood and gall,</hi> Lam. 3.15, 19. both which are <hi>bitter things;</hi> and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God is <hi>that</hi> that makes affliction ſo bitter.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:136185:122"/>Now <hi>wormwood</hi> and <hi>gall</hi> are ſuch things as every one would decline: Oh then much more will the Saints decline the <hi>anger of God,</hi> and pray that he would not be angry with them when they pray to him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is held out under the notion of <hi>a Bear robbed of her whelps,</hi> and of a <hi>Lion</hi> and <hi>Leopard,</hi> Hoſ. 13.7, 8. and theſe are fierce and tearing Creatures. When God is <hi>angry,</hi> he compares himſelf to ſuch Creatures as are <hi>fierce,</hi> and <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renting</hi> and <hi>tearing in pieces</hi> what they meet with: Now who would not deſire to be <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from a <hi>Lion,</hi> and <hi>Bear robbed of her whelps,</hi> and from a <hi>Leopard</hi> that <hi>watcheth to deſtroy?</hi> and if the Lords anger be like the <hi>fierceneſs</hi> of theſe Beaſts of Prey, there is great reaſon that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhould pray that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee that the anger of the Lord is <hi>a dreadful thing,</hi> for elſe Believers would not ſo pray to be delivered from it. If <hi>the Kings wrath</hi> be <hi>as the roaring of a Lion,</hi> Prov. 19.12. and <hi>as the meſſengers of death,</hi> Prov. 16.14. and <hi>whoſo provoketh him to anger, ſinneth againſt his own ſoul,</hi> Prov. 20.2. Oh what is it then when <hi>God is angry?</hi> Nahum 1.6. <hi>Who can ſtand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceneſs of his anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and the Rocks are thrown down by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:136185:123"/>him.</hi> Men make nothing of it to <hi>provoke him,</hi> but they ſhall know what his anger means, and what it is to ſtirre up <hi>this Lion,</hi> that will ſo <hi>roar,</hi> and <hi>rent,</hi> and <hi>tear,</hi> and <hi>kill,</hi> and <hi>devour:</hi> they ſhall finde it <hi>a dreadful anger,</hi> farre above any <hi>Kings anger,</hi> whoever he be.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſee the <hi>wofull eſtate</hi> of thoſe upon whom <hi>the wrath of God muſt abide for ever,</hi> Joh. 3.36. If <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed ſo that God would not be <hi>angry with him,</hi> ſurely they are in an ill caſe that muſt <hi>abide by it to all eternity:</hi> and who is able to undergo the <hi>ſeverity of his diſpleaſure?</hi> If <hi>his wrath be kindled but a little,</hi> there's no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of it; Oh how ſhall they then be able to endure it, in the <hi>extremity of it to all eternity?</hi> It's an <hi>hot hole</hi> where the Bellows blow in a furnace of Iron or Copper; Oh but what an <hi>hot hole is Hell</hi> then, <hi>which the breath and anger of the Lord, like a ſtream of Brimſtone, kindleth for ever?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſee what a mercy it is to be <hi>delivered from the heat of his anger;</hi> for Believers pray that God would not be angry with them: ſurely therefore it is a <hi>mercy</hi> when ſuch a ſhower falls not upon us, when this <hi>wrath is not poured upon us like fire,</hi> for there's no fire burns ſo hot as that; and this <hi>deliverance</hi> is by <hi>our Redeemer,</hi> Rom. 5.9. <hi>Being juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> He quencheth this <hi>fire,</hi> and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:136185:123"/>puts out all the <hi>ſparks</hi> of it: He dries up this <hi>Sea,</hi> and ſtills all the <hi>raging</hi> of it: He hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>drunk that Cup of Red Wine full of mixture</hi> of <hi>that</hi> that <hi>killed,</hi> and <hi>without mixture</hi> of what might <hi>allay</hi> it, that we might never drink it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We ſee what <hi>love</hi> we owe to Chriſt Jeſus, that delivereth us from <hi>the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.10. Oh, who ſhould have our hearts but he? where ſhould our love be <hi>laid out,</hi> but upon him? We would love one that plucked us out of the <hi>fire,</hi> that pulled us out of the <hi>Lions mouth,</hi> that got us out of the <hi>paw of the Bear,</hi> that reſcued us from the <hi>Leopards teeth and claws:</hi> and if ſo, what love is he worthy of, that hath plucked us out of <hi>the fire of Gods anger?</hi> and when it hath roared upon us like a <hi>Lion,</hi> and hath watched over us as the <hi>Leopard</hi> to make a prey of us, then he hath ſtood up to <hi>reſcue us:</hi> No love ever like <hi>his</hi> herein, and no love ſhould be above <hi>ours</hi> to him back again.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We ſee that his favour muſt needs be <hi>very ſweet,</hi> if his anger be <hi>that</hi> that is to be <hi>prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</hi> Life is ſweet, and <hi>in his favour is life,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. yea <hi>better then life,</hi> Pſal. 63.3. This life is ſweet, but <hi>his favour</hi> is above it; there's no ſweetneſs to be equalled or compared with it. The <hi>favour</hi> of a Prince <hi>is as the dew upon the graſs,</hi> Prov. 19.12. which makes it revive and flouriſh in its greenneſs and beauty; Oh what
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:136185:124"/>then is <hi>the favour of God?</hi> it muſt needs make us grow and flouriſh in viridity and greenneſs. If his anger be <hi>that</hi> we are to deſire to be delivered from, then his favour is <hi>that</hi> that we are to be delighted in, and is to be deſired after.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. We ſee that they that <hi>provoke God</hi> to anger are <hi>the greateſt enemies to themſelves;</hi> for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that are their own friends, pray that the Lord would not be angry with them. If <hi>he that provoketh a Prince, ſinneth againſt his own ſoul,</hi> Prov. 20.2. how do they <hi>ſin againſt their own ſouls</hi> that provoke God to anger? There are no ſuch <hi>enemies to themſelves</hi> as ſuch men be. And truly we have ſo many enemies abroad, that we had not need be our own enemies.</p>

If it be <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to dwell in a corner of the houſe, then with an angry woman in a wide houſe;</hi> Oh how will they do that are to endure Gods anger?

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lords anger.</hi> 1. If it ſhould <hi>kindle</hi> againſt us, there would be <hi>no ſpeaking to him.</hi> There's no wiſe man that would Petition to a Prince when he is angry with him; but if he be calm, and his ſpirit be appeaſed, and no anger appear in his face, or in his words or geſture, he will then be <hi>encouraged</hi> to ſpeak, and bring his Petition before him: So if God be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:136185:125"/>angry there is no ſpeaking to him, but if he be appeaſed toward us, then we may freely ſpeak what we have to ſay to him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here does.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His anger is <hi>a fierce anger,</hi> Nah. 1.6. and that muſt needs ſtop any mans mouth from ſpeaking. If a man be <hi>fierce in his anger,</hi> it is in vain to ſpeak to him: ſo here. But if he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to lay aſide his fierceneſs, then he may be ſpoken to: ſo it is with us <hi>in ſpeaking to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. His anger is ſuch that <hi>none can ſtand before it,</hi> Nah. 1.6. and therefore there is no ſpeaking in way of ſuit till it be removed: but when this is gone, then we may have free acceſs to him, and ſpeak what we will in his ears.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His anger is as <hi>a Cloud that he covers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with,</hi> Lam. 3.44. <hi>that our prayers cannot paſs thorow;</hi> and therefore ſo long as that <hi>cloud</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, there's no ſpeaking in Prayer to him: but when it is taken away, then our Prayers may come before him, and be accepted.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His anger is <hi>long ere it be removed,</hi> Pſ. 80.4. God is <hi>ſlow to anger,</hi> not eaſily provoked; but when once he is angry, he is not quickly pacified, and that will hinder our Prayers: but now when this is <hi>removed,</hi> then we may ſpeak as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> here does.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. His anger is <hi>an unknown anger,</hi> Pſal. 90.11. we may know other things, but we do not know
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:136185:126"/>the <hi>force</hi> of this, and being ſo powerful, it will ſtop our mouthes: but if this be <hi>removed,</hi> then we may ſpeak all our minde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From Believers.</hi> 1. They may <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God for any thing,</hi> Matth. 21.22. and therefore may well be <hi>encouraged</hi> to ſpeak to him when he is not angry with them: he cannot ſay them <hi>nay</hi> in what they ſue for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>his friends,</hi> Jam. 2.23. and <hi>friends</hi> may ſpeak freely to God, eſpecially when they have prayed to him that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>his favourites,</hi> they <hi>finde grace in his ſight,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 33.12. and they may ſpeak what they will in the ears of their Prince.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> Joh. 1.12. and they may be bold to ask <hi>any thing</hi> of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially when he is not angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>his Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3.17. <hi>his peculiar Treaſure,</hi> Pſal. 135.4. and they that are ſo <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to him,</hi> may be <hi>encouraged to ſpeak to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are they that <hi>he hath given his own Son Chriſt unto,</hi> Rom. 8.32. and therefore they may ſpeak, and have any thing given to them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>put up to him</hi> who is <hi>a God hearing prayer,</hi> Pſ. 65.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are made to him that <hi>commands us to ask,</hi> Mat. 7.7.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. They are brought before him, who (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10.) bids us <hi>open our mouthes wide,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are directed to him who is <hi>God All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient,</hi> that <hi>can do every thing,</hi> Jer. 32.17, 27. Job 42.2.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>delightful to him,</hi> Prov. 15.8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>mingled with Chriſts interceſſion,</hi> Rev. 8.3. and <hi>accepted in him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. All which conſidered, they may be <hi>encouraged</hi> to ſpeak and pray to him.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee what cauſe we have to <hi>look to it,</hi> that God be not <hi>provoked by us</hi> when we go to pray to him; for if he be, we ſhall not be able <hi>to ſpeak to any purpoſe</hi> in his ears.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that they that come to <hi>a reconciled God,</hi> may ſpeak their mindes freely to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that if <hi>God be angry,</hi> there's no ſpeaking to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that <hi>wicked men</hi> cannot ſpeak in Prayer to God, <hi>with whom he is angry every day,</hi> Pſal. 7.11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that they are <hi>happy</hi> that have Gods anger <hi>turned from them,</hi> as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. for ſuch may be <hi>encouraged</hi> to ſpeak as <hi>Abraham</hi> here did.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee that there's <hi>no going to an angry God.</hi> What can any man look for from an angry Prince?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee how <hi>precious</hi> Chriſt ſhould be to us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. who makes <hi>us</hi> and <hi>our prayers
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:136185:127"/>acceptable to God,</hi> Epheſ. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.5.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee that if we would go with <hi>courage</hi> to pray before the Lord, we muſt firſt <hi>prevail with him</hi> not to be angry with us.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſee that as there is <hi>enough</hi> in Gods <hi>anger</hi> to ſtop any mans mouth in Prayer; ſo when he is <hi>appeaſed,</hi> there's <hi>enough in that</hi> to open any mans mouth to pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We ſee that none but thoſe that have <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſts reconciling grace,</hi> can make an effectuall Prayer.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From the Believers themſelves. 3. From the Prayers they put up to him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He hath <hi>enough by him</hi> to give us more when we ask of him, and therefore we may well deſire to get ſomething more from him: He is <hi>a full one,</hi> and can <hi>fulfill the deſires of them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 145.19. and if he would not have us ſend the poor away <hi>empty</hi> from us, when we <hi>have it by us,</hi> Prov. 3.27, 28. then we may well deſire to get ſomething more from <hi>ſuch an one,</hi> that hath <hi>enough by him</hi> to give to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>a bountiful one, Rich unto all that call upon him,</hi> Rom. 10.12. and therefore in every requeſt that we put up to him, we may deſire <hi>ſomething more</hi> from him. Petitioners that ſue to bountiful Princes, may expect more from them, when-ever they come before them: So we, when we come before the Lord, he ſends none <hi>empty away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He calls upon us to <hi>open our mouthes wide,</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:136185:128"/>to enlarge our deſires, to ask much of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10. and therefore we may well deſire to get <hi>ſomething more of him,</hi> as often as we come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>loves his people,</hi> Deut. 33.3. Pſal. 146.8. and they that <hi>love</hi> others, are willing to give more and more to them at their asking; and therefore ſuch as come to them, may well deſire to get ſomething more of them then formerly they have had: So may we of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>gives to all liberally, and upbraideth not</hi> when we <hi>ask in faith,</hi> Jam. 5.6. and therefore in every requeſt that we put up to him, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>ſomething more</hi> then formerly we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>Rewards bounty in us abundantly,</hi> Luke 6.38. and therefore we may well deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive bountifully of him, and to deſire that we may have <hi>ſomething more of him</hi> in every requeſt that we put up to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themſelves:</hi> 1. They are of <hi>a noble ſpirit themſelves,</hi> as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Gen. 14.22, 23, 24. ſo <hi>Araunah,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.23. and if they be ſo <hi>royal in giving,</hi> then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may well look that God ſhould be <hi>more Royall,</hi> and deſire more of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have <hi>large promiſes made to them,</hi> Pſal. 81.10. Joh. 16.23. and having ſuch <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> they may deſire when-ever they pray to him, to get <hi>ſomething more</hi> of him then formerly they have received.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:136185:128"/>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>the deſire of his eyes,</hi> and <hi>the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment of his heart,</hi> Cant. 2.14. &amp; 4.9. and they that are ſuch, may in every requeſt they make deſire <hi>ſomething more</hi> of him then formerly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>his excellent ones,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. and though they look at themſelves as <hi>vile,</hi> yet they are more <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> in his eyes for that, and may deſire to get <hi>ſomething more</hi> of him. The more <hi>little</hi> we are in our own eyes, the more <hi>eſteem</hi> we are of in his.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are ſuch as are <hi>purchaſed by his Sons Blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. and what may they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in their requeſts of him?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>lovers of him,</hi> Pſal. 69.36. and what may not they deſire of him? they may deſire in all their requeſts to get <hi>ſomething more</hi> of him then formerly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers they put up:</hi> 1. They are <hi>Odours,</hi> Rev. 5.8. of a ſweet ſavour to him through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>pure prayers,</hi> Job 16.17. and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up with <hi>holy hands and hearts,</hi> Jam. 4.8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>humble</hi> Prayers, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> was here, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>unfeigned</hi> deſires and Prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>fervent</hi> Prayers, Jam. 5.16, 17. there's <hi>fire</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>inwrought</hi> Prayers, <hi>ibid.</hi> the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:136185:129"/>
                     <hi>heart</hi> is in them: and being ſuch Prayers, no wonder if Believers in every requeſt that they make deſire to get <hi>ſomething more</hi> then formerly they have had from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee how in an holy wiſe <hi>bold</hi> Believers are with the Lord, that deſire <hi>ſomething more</hi> in every requeſt that they put up, then formerly they have received. It would be ſo with men, and is ſo in our ſuits we make to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that <hi>ſtinted</hi> Prayers <hi>enjoyned,</hi> and no other then ſuch to be uſed, fall ſhort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayers of Faith, for they ask for the ſame things, and for no more then the <hi>Book</hi> ſets down, which have been asked a thouſand times over; not but that ſome requeſts may be the ſame, if ſome <hi>new ones</hi> be put in with them, for Chriſt ſaid <hi>the ſame words</hi> ſometimes in praying as well as in Preaching.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that Faith looks at God as a <hi>boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and liberal giver,</hi> Jam. 1.5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that Believers think they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive <hi>enough</hi> from the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that the beſt of men are <hi>indigent men,</hi> and ſtand in need of more and more ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from the Lord. We are all of the <hi>craving hand</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee what <hi>longings</hi> we ſhould have here, for the enjoyment of God in heaven, where we
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:136185:129"/>ſhall be at the <hi>Well-head,</hi> and never deſiring more; for here we are <hi>alwayes deſiring more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee what a <hi>full one</hi> God is that we make our requeſts unto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee the <hi>excellency</hi> of Believers above other men, they have <hi>larger deſires</hi> then others: other men though they <hi>have not,</hi> yet they <hi>ask not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſee that God hath never the <hi>leſs</hi> for all that we have of him; for, <hi>faith</hi> ſtill <hi>deſires more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. We ſee that Believers (though <hi>bountiful</hi>) yet are <hi>covetous</hi> in an <hi>holy way,</hi> they <hi>deſire more.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>Abundant in goodneſs,</hi> Exod. 34.6. and ſcatters plentifully to thoſe that deſire to ſhare in his bounty; as <hi>Boaz</hi> did to <hi>Ruth</hi> that came to <hi>glean in his field,</hi> Ruth 2.15, 16.

                  <p n="2">2. As he is <hi>abundant in goodneſs,</hi> ſo he <hi>does not grudge</hi> to give more to us, when we deſire it of him.

                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>they</hi> that do <hi>glorifie God,</hi> Rom. 4.20. and he will not deny to give more to them that <hi>give glory to him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From our ſelves. 3. From the nature of Believers boldneſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He loves to ſee his <hi>friends bold with him.</hi> So it is with ſome kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted men, they love to ſee their friends bold with them, and not <hi>once,</hi> but <hi>often:</hi> So does the the Lord, who is kinde to his friends, and farre more kinde then all the kinde-hearted men in the world put all together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He calls upon us to <hi>come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4.16. not <hi>once,</hi> but ſo <hi>often as we are in need;</hi> and that encourageth
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:136185:132"/>believing Suppliants to make further bold with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He will at <hi>any time</hi> give to <hi>importunate Suiters,</hi> though they ſhould ſeem to come <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably,</hi> yet if they be <hi>bold,</hi> and in an holy wiſe <hi>impudent,</hi> ſo as to take <hi>no nay,</hi> he will be free to give: this is held out in that Parable <hi>Luke</hi> 11.5-8. <hi>Importunity</hi> does ſometimes more then <hi>Friendſhip</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> when we are not <hi>bold with him,</hi> becauſe we do not take him to be ſuch a friend as indeed he is; for if we did ſo judge, we would be <hi>more bold with him,</hi> Iſa. 64.7.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He makes account that ſuch <hi>caſt off fear,</hi> as <hi>reſtrain prayer,</hi> and are not <hi>bold with him,</hi> Job 15.4. and Believers are loth to have that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them, for <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> go together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He alwayes makes us <hi>the more welcome, the more bold</hi> we are with him when we pray to him. <hi>Abraham</hi> loſt nothing by <hi>taking upon him to ſpeak unto the Lord,</hi> and being <hi>further bold with him.</hi> A bold friend findes <hi>hearty welcome</hi> from men, much more from the Lord; they that ſue ofteneſt ſpeed the beſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From our ſelves.</hi> 1. We ſue to a God who hath ſaid that we <hi>ſhall not ſeek his face in vain,</hi> Iſa. 45.19. and therefore may be <hi>bold with him,</hi> and make <hi>further bold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:136185:133"/>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſue to him who hath given out that great word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11. <hi>Ask me of things to come concerning my ſons, and concerning the work of my hands command me;</hi> which none of us durſt have thought of, had not he ſpoken it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſue to him that hath ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10. that if we be ſo bold as to <hi>open our mouthes wide,</hi> and enlarge our deſires, <hi>he will fill and ſatisfit them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We go to him who is <hi>the God of all grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10. and therefore can ſupply us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. What cannot that <hi>God of all grace</hi> bring in to us? <hi>All grace</hi> is more then <hi>Rich grace:</hi> A man may be <hi>Rich,</hi> and yet not have <hi>All;</hi> but God is not onely <hi>Rich in grace,</hi> but <hi>the God of all grace,</hi> and therefore can make <hi>all grace</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound towards us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſue to him who will never ſend us <hi>empty away,</hi> who turns none away from his doors without relief: His ſuiters ſhall never go <hi>ſad away</hi> from him. He <hi>ſends the rich empty away,</hi> that think they need nothing, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.53. <hi>but filleth the hungry with good things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We go to him that hath ſaid, that <hi>Every one that asketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened,</hi> Mat. 7.8. and therefore we may be <hi>bold,</hi> and <hi>further bold</hi> with him. We may be bold to think that he will not be harder to us then he is to every one.</p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:136185:133"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the nature of Believers boldneſs.</hi> 1. It draws us <hi>nearer unto God,</hi> and that God <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth</hi> in: we get near to <hi>the Throne of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It makes a man <hi>go out of himſelf</hi> more, and ſee what need he hath of ſupplies from Heaven: and that's a gracious frame of heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It lets us ſee <hi>our own unworthineſs,</hi> Gen. 32.10, 11. Luke 15.21. and that God takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It holds up <hi>our friendſhip with God,</hi> and aſſureth us that we are <hi>his friends,</hi> in that we make ſo <hi>bold with him,</hi> Jam. 2.23.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is the very <hi>Suburbs</hi> and <hi>Gate of Heaven,</hi> for they in Heaven can be <hi>holily bold</hi> with the Lord, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a <hi>bleſſed fruit</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Aſcenſion,</hi> Heb. 4.14, 16. Upon all which grounds Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be <hi>bold,</hi> and <hi>further bold</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee what a <hi>gracious God</hi> we ſue to, that we may be <hi>bold,</hi> and <hi>further bold</hi> with in our requeſts that we put up to him. He proclaimed his Name thus of old, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,</hi> Exod. 34.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that Believers have <hi>great intereſt</hi> in him, that may be ſo <hi>bold with him</hi> as to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to <hi>ſpeak again</hi> and <hi>again</hi> thus to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that <hi>great is the friendſhip</hi> that is between God and Believing Souls. Great hath
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:136185:134"/>been the friendſhip that hath been between ſome men, but none like this between God and his believing ones.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee that to be <hi>bold with God,</hi> and to be <hi>further bold with him</hi> in our requeſts that we put up to him, is an argument that God is very near to us, and we very near and dear to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that ſurely we ſhall be <hi>near indeed</hi> to him in heaven, when <hi>faith</hi> is turned into <hi>viſion</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee that if we make ſo <hi>bold with him here,</hi> in praying to him; Oh what <hi>holy boldneſs</hi> ſhall we have with him when he claſps us in his <hi>Everlaſting Arms,</hi> and puts us into <hi>his Boſome</hi> to all Eternity?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee that though Believers are the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſteſt men</hi> that are, yet they are the <hi>boldeſt men</hi> alſo; for they can <hi>take upon them to ſpeak to God,</hi> and to be <hi>further bold</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee that no men nor Devils ſhall be able to <hi>daſh them out of countenance,</hi> for they can be <hi>bold</hi> with God himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſee a reaſon of that in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. That that makes us <hi>bold</hi> with God, will make us <hi>victorious</hi> over the wicked one.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We ſee how bold we ſhould be in a <hi>good cauſe,</hi> and for a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Acts 4.</p>

                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:136185:135"/>that he <hi>delights in,</hi> that ſhould we delight to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to the utmoſt, and he will alſo delight in our improvement of it, as he did all along in <hi>Abrahams</hi> here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themſelves:</hi> 1. They have <hi>experience of his mercy</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and therefore improve it all they can in behalf of others. <hi>Abraham</hi> found the Lord <hi>merciful to himſelf,</hi> and therefore improves <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are of a merciful <hi>diſpoſition to others. Righteous</hi> and <hi>Merciful men</hi> are coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. Now being of a merciful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, hence it is that they do improve the the Lords mercy what they can for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Believers have a <hi>promiſe,</hi> that <hi>being merciful they ſhall obtain mercy,</hi> Mat. 5.7. and that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall be no loſers by it, and therefore may well improve the Lords mercy for others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They know that it's <hi>Gods will</hi> that they ſhould <hi>love mercy,</hi> Mic. 6.8. and this way they ſhew their <hi>love of mercy,</hi> in improving Gods mercy to others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God,</hi> and this way ſhew it, by improving the <hi>mercy of God</hi> in behalf of others, as well as for themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>like God,</hi> and he is <hi>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and ſo are they, in improving his <hi>mercy</hi> as
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:136185:136"/>far as may be for the good of others. <hi>God is good, does good,</hi> Pſal. 119.68. and the further a ſweet Fountain runs, the better it is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They <hi>often prevail for others,</hi> as well as for Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Abraham</hi> miſſed not of one of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for wicked <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their Prayers, if they ſhould <hi>miſs for others,</hi> yet will <hi>return into their own boſomes,</hi> Pſal. 35.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their Prayers <hi>pierce heaven,</hi> 2 Chro. 30.27.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They have a kinde of <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They bring the Lord to <hi>our beck,</hi> Iſa. 58.9.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are never <hi>in vain,</hi> Iſa. 45.19. and is not ſuch mercy worth the improving?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee how <hi>full of love</hi> Believers are to others, that are ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to improve the Lords mercy ſo farre for their good. <hi>Abraham</hi> deſires mercy for <hi>Sodom,</hi> if there were but <hi>twenty righteous</hi> found amongſt them. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> ever go together, lodge in the ſame breaſt, and take up together in the ſame heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that Believers are not <hi>all for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but very deſirous that others ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lords mercy with them. <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>communicative grace,</hi> and does not centre within it ſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:136185:136"/>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee how <hi>precious</hi> Believers ſhould be in our eyes, for they are ſuch as do <hi>all they can</hi> to make others partakers of Gods mercy, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. Jewels communicate their beauty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as retain it within themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee how Believers reſemble God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he <hi>is good,</hi> and <hi>does good,</hi> Pſal. 119.68. and ſo do they.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that they that <hi>ſhare</hi> in the Lords mercy themſelves, are not <hi>ſo content,</hi> but would have others <hi>partake in it</hi> alſo; and therefore ſo deſire it for them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee what <hi>love will be in heaven,</hi> if Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have ſo much here on earth: there's <hi>all love</hi> there, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee that the Lords mercy is a <hi>rich Myne</hi> and <hi>Treaſure,</hi> ſeeing it may be ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Believers do ſo deſire to improve it for others.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee what improvement we ſhould make of Gods mercy to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſee that Believers do well in <hi>fulfilling the Royal Law,</hi> Jam. 2.8.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We ſee what <hi>longings</hi> we ſhould have after heaven, for then the Lords mercy will be <hi>fully manifeſted,</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>

                  <p>So does the Lord here: <hi>Abraham</hi> deſires that if there be but <hi>twenty Righteous</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> that he would not <hi>deſtroy it;</hi> and God <hi>condeſcends</hi> to him in his requeſt, and ſayes <hi>he will not deſtroy it for twenties ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From his believing Suppliants. 3. From their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>a God ready to forgive,</hi> Neh. 9.17. Pſal. 86.5. and not to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlict puniſhment,</hi> eſpecially when ſued unto by Believers. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.11.-14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.13-21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He <hi>prepares their hearts,</hi> and then cauſeth <hi>his ear to hear,</hi> Pſal. 10.17. He that gives <hi>heart-preparation,</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:136185:137"/>he ever lends a <hi>liſtening ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>provides for the Ravens when his young ones cry unto God,</hi> Job 38.41. Pſal. 147.9. and if he come down ſo low as to hear them, then ſure he will not diſdain to <hi>condeſcend</hi> to his believing Suppliants that ſue to him in behalf of others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>gives the beaſts their food,</hi> ibid. and they make but an harſh ſound; they ſome of them <hi>roar,</hi> as the <hi>Bear</hi> and <hi>Lion;</hi> and ſome of them <hi>bray,</hi> as the <hi>Aſs;</hi> and ſome of them <hi>bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> as the <hi>Ox:</hi> and if he condeſcend ſo low as to hear ſuch noiſes and voices, how much more will he come low in hearing his believing Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants, whoever they pray for?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is a God that is <hi>merciful and gracious,</hi> Exod. 34.6. and therefore hears them in behalf of whomſoever they ſue for: His <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> makes him thus to <hi>condeſcend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He hears ſometimes farre <hi>worſe then they:</hi> The Iſraelites <hi>murmured at the Red-ſea,</hi> yet <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.9. God <hi>heard their cry</hi> there, to ſave them with a temporal ſalvation, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they were <hi>deſtroyed in the wilderneſs,</hi> Jude ver. 5. and if he would hear <hi>ſuch,</hi> much more will he condeſcend to hear his believing Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, on whoſe behalf ſoever they ſue for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themſelves:</hi> 1. They have <hi>much communion with him,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 5.22. &amp; 6.9. and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:136185:138"/>God will condeſcend much to thoſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>accepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6. and what is it that they may not prevail for? he will condeſcend much for their ſakes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They <hi>pleaſe him,</hi> Heb. 11.5. and ſuch as ſo do may have any thing of him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They <hi>raviſh his heart,</hi> Cant. 4.9. that <hi>one eye</hi> of their <hi>Faith</hi> wins his heart; he is <hi>taken with it,</hi> as a Lover is with the beauty of <hi>that eye</hi> that he beholds, his heart is incloſed in <hi>that eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>they</hi> that are very <hi>dear to Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 12.49, 50. &amp; what may not <hi>they have</hi> of him?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are ſuch as this King <hi>delighteth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and they may have <hi>great things</hi> done for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.26. See for illuſtration <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6.6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers:</hi> 1. They are the <hi>breathings of his Spirit,</hi> he <hi>endites</hi> them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. &amp; will not God <hi>condeſcend</hi> to do much for them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are the <hi>Requeſts of the Spirit,</hi> ibid. and ſhall not the Spirits requeſts <hi>be heard?</hi> will not God <hi>condeſcend</hi> far to theſe?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>the groanings of the Spirit,</hi> ibid. when they <hi>cannot ſpeak,</hi> he helps them <hi>to groan,</hi> and he hears <hi>groans</hi> as well as <hi>words,</hi> Pſal. 102.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are as <hi>Incenſe,</hi> Pſal. 141.2. and the ſmoke of that went upward.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>Odours,</hi> ſweet in the noſthrils of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>perfumed with Chriſts Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:136185:138"/>Rev. 8.3. and will not God condeſcend far, and do much for theſe Prayers?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee what <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendency</hi> we ſhould uſe to thoſe that are <hi>ſuiters</hi> and <hi>petitioners</hi> to us; we ſhould be <hi>followers of God</hi> herein, and come off to them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and condeſcend all that ever we can to them: we cannot have a better pattern to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee what a <hi>gracious God</hi> the Lord our God is, that does ſo farre condeſcend to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Suppliants when they ſue to him in behalf of others: No gracious Prince like him, that ſtoops ſo <hi>low,</hi> and comes off ſo <hi>largely</hi> to them that ſue to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee what encouragement we have to <hi>improve Gods mercy</hi> in ſuing to him in behalf of others, for he <hi>condeſcends</hi> very farre to us when we ſpeak in their behalf: he <hi>ſmiles</hi> upon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and gives the thing we ſue for; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ask any thing, but we have it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee who muſt have the <hi>glory</hi> of what he grants, in ſo farre <hi>condeſcending</hi> to us in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of others, it is not from any <hi>worthineſs</hi> of us that ſue, or of thoſe that are ſued for, but of his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and he muſt have the glory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee the great <hi>humility</hi> of the Lord, that ſtoops ſo low to poor vile duſt and aſhes; it ſhould make us wonder at it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.5, 6. no
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:136185:139"/>humility like this of the great God towards ſuch earth and clay as we are.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee how <hi>precious</hi> Believers are in his eyes, that thus <hi>condeſcends</hi> to them in granting what they ask of him in behalf of others, and in coming down ſo <hi>low</hi> to their deſires for them. Surely they are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> as he ſtyles them <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. and very precious to him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee that Believers Prayers are like <hi>ſweet Odours,</hi> for elſe God would never <hi>condeſcend</hi> ſo low as he does to them, in hearing them for others as well as for themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.

                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9.

If a man give another leave to be <hi>bold</hi> with him, he will try him ſo far as may be: So God giving us leave to be bold with him, hence it is that we may go as far as we <hi>dare</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He <hi>delights</hi> to ſee his children asking <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of him. Fathers love to have their children asking of them as far as they <hi>dare;</hi> and ſo does the Lord our Father: and that makes us ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ask ſo far of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath the <hi>bowels</hi> of all the <hi>deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in him, and what is to be found in <hi>all of them,</hi> is infinitely more to be found in him, and therefore we may be willing to ſpeak as far as we can to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He puts us on to ask <hi>great things of him,</hi> and would not have us <hi>confined</hi> to our own nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row deſires, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.3. and Believers are willing to put him to it, and try him to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>exceeds</hi> our deſires, gives us <hi>more</hi> then we ask, as he did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 3.13. and therefore we may ſpeak as far as we <hi>can</hi> or <hi>dare</hi> to him.</p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:136185:140"/>
                  <p n="6">6. He is diſpleaſed when we <hi>ſcant our deſires</hi> to him. Look as the Prophet was angry with the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſparing to <hi>ſmite on the ground,</hi> 2 Kings 13.18, 19. ſo the Lord will be angry when we <hi>ſpare to ſpeak:</hi> we might <hi>have more,</hi> if we would <hi>ſpeak more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the believing Suppliants:</hi> 1. They finde <hi>grace in his ſight,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 33.12. and who may ſpeak freely and largely, if not they?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have found by experience that <hi>God bath come off largely to them,</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſcant their deſires to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have encouragement to <hi>enlarge their deſires,</hi> both by his Commandment and Promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10. and what ſhould then hinder?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>Princes with God,</hi> Gen. 32.28. and being ſuch, they may well ſpeak largely, and ask all they can of him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They go to one that is both <hi>full and free,</hi> Gen. 17.1. Jam. 1.5. and therefore they may well enlarge their deſires all that may be.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are his <hi>choice portion,</hi> Deut. 32.9. his <hi>garden encloſed,</hi> Cant. 4.12. that he drops abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly his bleſſings upon: The reſt of the world may be <hi>parched,</hi> and <hi>dry as a wilderneſs,</hi> but they <hi>drink of the dew of heaven,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may gape wide, and enlarge their deſires for thoſe they make their ſupplication for.</p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:136185:141"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>heard for much,</hi> as well as for <hi>little,</hi> 1 Jo. 5.14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>moſt accepted,</hi> when the ſuiters <hi>ask moſt,</hi> and when they ſpeak as far as they can, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have <hi>prevailed with men,</hi> and God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>above men</hi> in giving liberally. We reade of <hi>half a Kingdome</hi> that they have come off with, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.23. but what's that to what God gives? <hi>Himſelf,</hi> his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> his <hi>Heavenly Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are none of them <hi>loſt,</hi> ſuch Prayers are not <hi>turned away,</hi> Pſal. 66.20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>the Souls Ambaſſadors,</hi> and they effect what they are ſent about, and negotiate great things for us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They ſometimes prevail <hi>before they are put up,</hi> and <hi>while we are ſpeaking,</hi> Iſa. 65.24. Dan. 9.20-23. All which conſidered, what wonder is it that they ſpeak as far as ever they can in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of thoſe that they make ſupplication for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee the <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection</hi> that is in believing ſuppliants to thoſe they ſue for, they will go as far as ever they can in their deſires for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that Believers are <hi>onely they</hi> that can be bold with God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi> are ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants, and ever go together, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:136185:141"/>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee what we are to do, if we would make it out that we are <hi>true Blievers,</hi> we muſt do as <hi>Abraham</hi> here did.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee what <hi>longings</hi> we ſhould have for Heaven, where <hi>Love</hi> will be in its <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee how far our deſires ſhould be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged</hi> for the diſtreſſes of our dear Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men abroad.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee that in all our Prayers we are to go <hi>as far as we can</hi> with the Lord, and put him to it, in <hi>improving his mercy</hi> to the utmoſt. We ſue to a gracious God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee what <hi>boldneſs</hi> we ought to uſe in <hi>ſuing to men</hi> in behalf of thoſe that we petition for: we may put them to it, and ask freely of them, for they are to be <hi>followers of God as dear children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſee what a precious grace <hi>Faith</hi> is, that makes us ſo <hi>humbly bold</hi> with the Lord, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We ſee that ſurely Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>much more</hi> for us; the <hi>Merit of his blood,</hi> Heb. 12.24. and <hi>his Interceſſion,</hi> ſpeak aloud for us.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>never weary of doing his people good;</hi> though they follow him therefore with ſuit upon ſuit, and go as far as they <hi>can</hi> in their <hi>deſires,</hi> yet they <hi>cannot weary him,</hi> and therefore have the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of their deſires given in to them. We may <hi>weary men,</hi> Prov. 25.17. but not <hi>him,</hi> Iſa. 40.28. We ſometimes are <hi>weary of him,</hi> Iſa. 43.22. but he is not <hi>weary of hearkning to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He can come up to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: He is an <hi>Almighty One,</hi> Job 42.2. and therefore can give all that we deſire of him.</p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:136185:142"/>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath put it into the hearts of ſome men to <hi>give to the utmoſt</hi> of what their Petitioners ſue for, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did to the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> 1 Kin. 10.13. and will not he then grant the requeſts of his Suiters to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of what they deſire of him? He is more <hi>Royal in giving</hi> then all the <hi>Royal Kings</hi> in the world put all together.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath commanded us to be <hi>liberal to our ſervants,</hi> Deut. 15.13, 14. and will not he then come off <hi>liberally</hi> to them that <hi>ſerve him,</hi> and <hi>pray unto him?</hi> ſurely he will come off to them to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of their deſires that they put up to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>fills every living thing, and ſatisfies their deſires,</hi> Pſal. 145.16. and will he not then give in to Believers the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of their deſires, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them? He will ſurely do it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>ſaves to the utmoſt,</hi> Hebr. 7.25. and therefore <hi>grants to the utmoſt</hi> what his believing Suppliants ſue unto him for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themſelves:</hi> 1. According to their <hi>faith</hi> they do <hi>receive mercy</hi> at the Lords hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.29. Now their <hi>utmoſt deſires</hi> being put up in <hi>faith,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>that faith</hi> thoſe deſires are given in to them to the <hi>utmoſt.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. They <hi>pleaſe him by their faith,</hi> Heb. 11.5. and if ſo, then ſurely he cannot but give them in their deſires to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> that they bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>So did <hi>Abraham</hi> here, when he came ſo low as to deſire that if there were but <hi>ten Righteous</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> the place might not be deſtroyed, and had a <hi>gracious anſwer</hi> given in to him; he then ceaſed to ask any further, and <hi>left off ſuing</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God <hi>left off giving.</hi> Had he gone yet <hi>lower,</hi> and deſired for <hi>five,</hi> whatever the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> ſay, for ought either they or I know, God might have granted his deſire in that alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From the Believers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He hath not <hi>ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us,</hi> nor ſet any bounds to our Prayers, that <hi>hitherto we ſhall go and no further,</hi> and <hi>here our deſires ſhall ſtay;</hi> though he hath ſo bounded the Sea, <hi>Job</hi> 38.11. yet he hath not ſo limited and bounded our Prayers: but <hi>if we ask in faith,</hi> and <hi>deſire any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> Matth. 21.22. 1 Joh. 5.14, 15. and therefore we muſt needs leave off <hi>ſuing,</hi> before he leave off <hi>granting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As he hath ſet <hi>no bounds</hi> to our Prayers, ſo <hi>he hath not turned away our prayer, nor his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:136185:145"/>from us,</hi> Pſal. 66.20. Men ſometimes do ſo to thoſe that ask of them, but God never does; we may go as often as we will, and for what we will, if it be lawful that we ask, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: and therefore we <hi>leave off asking,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>leaves off to give.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He could not elſe take this <hi>noble Title</hi> to himſelf, to be <hi>A God hearing Prayer,</hi> Pſal. 65.2. if he ſhould not be as ready to <hi>grant</hi> as we are to <hi>ask:</hi> if he ſhould <hi>ceaſe to grant</hi> before we <hi>ceaſe to ask,</hi> that Title would be blotted out; but he will be ever known by that Title, it is his <hi>Name,</hi> and though ſome men have forgotten their own names, yet he will never forget his, but will have it known all the world over that he is <hi>A God hearing Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He findes fault with us that we ask no more: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22. <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me, O Jacob, but haſt been weary of me, O Iſrael:</hi> and 64.7. the Prophet complains, <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee:</hi> and if this diſpleaſe him ſo, then ſure we leave off to <hi>ſue,</hi> before he to <hi>grant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He encourageth us to ask by his <hi>Promiſes</hi> that he makes to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid to <hi>Bathſheba, Ask on, my Mother, for I will not ſay thee nay,</hi> 1 Kin. 2.20. So the Lord does encourage us to <hi>ask on;</hi> and if ſo, then it is not <hi>he,</hi> but <hi>we</hi> that fail if we ask not:
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:136185:145"/>we leave off <hi>petitioning</hi> before he leave <hi>granting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He hath his doors ever open, his <hi>Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat</hi> and <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> ever ſet up, that we may repair to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. and therefore our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires fail,</hi> ſooner then his <hi>will to grant,</hi> becauſe his <hi>doors</hi> are never ſhut, nor his <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver barred up, but we may go to it when we will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themſelves:</hi> 1. We have <hi>narrow hearts,</hi> and our deſires are ſcant, and are not ſo full as his hand is in giving: He opens his hand <hi>wide,</hi> but we <hi>ſhut</hi> our hearts. Narrow mouth'd veſſels receive in little, though it rain abundantly: ſuch veſſels are our hearts, were they more open, and more capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, we might have more; but the narrowneſs of our deſires and hearts makes us <hi>leave off pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning,</hi> before he <hi>leave giving:</hi> even <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf, though he had a larger heart then other men, yet had it <hi>more ſtraitned</hi> then Gods hand was to give.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are apt to <hi>ſtint our ſelves,</hi> and to ſet <hi>bounds</hi> to our deſires: <hi>I will ſpeak yet but this once,</hi> ſayes <hi>Abraham</hi> here. And we <hi>ſtinting our ſelves,</hi> hence it comes to paſs that we ſooner <hi>ceaſe</hi> to make our requeſts, then the Lord to <hi>give out</hi> his grants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are afraid that he may be <hi>angry with us</hi> for asking him ſo much, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here was, and that <hi>ſhortens</hi> our deſires, and <hi>bars up</hi> our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:136185:146"/>ſo that we have ſooner done petitioning, then the Lord hath in granting. The fear of a Princes <hi>anger</hi> ſtops his mouth that is to ſue to him, and makes him lay by his Petition: ſo here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are apt to make an inſinuation of our <hi>modeſty,</hi> that we would not go beyond <hi>due bounds</hi> in asking, and this makes us ceaſe petitioning, before the Lord leaves off to grant: So did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> here, he was a modeſt ſuiter, <hi>I will ſpeak</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>yet but this once.</hi> So do modeſt ſuiters to men, that would give more if <hi>asked;</hi> and ſo do we to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We are apt to think that we may be <hi>too bold in asking,</hi> and that will cauſe us to ceaſe our ſuits. They that make <hi>over-bold</hi> with Princes are not wiſe, and ſometimes get a frown for it: Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he was bold with the Lord, yet he was afraid he might be <hi>too bold,</hi> and therefore gave over <hi>ſuing,</hi> before the Lord gave over <hi>granting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are far ſhort (even the beſt of us) of <hi>thoſe bowels of mercy and compaſſion that are in God.</hi> We are made partakers of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture according to our <hi>meaſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. but fall ſhort, and as <hi>far ſhort</hi> as <hi>finite creatures</hi> do of the <hi>Infinite One,</hi> in thoſe Perfections that are in him, and in particular this of <hi>Mercy:</hi> and therefore though our bowels may work us up to <hi>deſire much,</hi> yet it is nothing to what is in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:136185:146"/>Lord himſelf: ours are <hi>mites,</hi> but his <hi>Talents;</hi> ours are <hi>atomes</hi> and <hi>motes,</hi> but his like <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi> ours like a <hi>candle,</hi> but his like the <hi>Sun;</hi> ours <hi>little rivulets,</hi> his like <hi>the great Sea.</hi> Now then his bowels being ſo <hi>full and large,</hi> and ours ſo <hi>ſcant,</hi> it is not to be marvelled at if we <hi>leave off petitioning,</hi> before he <hi>leave off granting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee how <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly we are engaged to the Lord</hi> for his mercy, in that he <hi>ſtops not our mouthes</hi> in praying to him, but lets it appear that we <hi>leave off petitioning</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>leaves off granting;</hi> he might juſtly <hi>turn away our prayer, and his mercy from us,</hi> but his Name is for ever to be praiſed for it, that he does it not: ſo <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.20. and ſo are we to ſay, and count our ſelves indebted to him, that will not deny us in <hi>any thing</hi> that we <hi>ſue</hi> for, but ſo long as we pray, gives us in our deſires, and lets us <hi>leave ſuing,</hi> before he <hi>leave granting.</hi> We are never able enough to <hi>exalt his Name</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee what an <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>bountiful,</hi> and <hi>royall One</hi> we have to do with, that ceaſeth not to grant our deſires that we put up to him, but we leave off <hi>ſuing,</hi> before he ceaſeth <hi>giving.</hi> It is not thus with men, it is not thus with Princes, for though they come off royally to thoſe that are in favour with them, and ſue to them, yet they put a <hi>period</hi> to their grants: but our God
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:136185:147"/>is more royal then they, for he does never ceaſe giving, before we ceaſe asking.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſee what <hi>narrow hearts</hi> we have, and how contracted our deſires are, that we have ſooner done <hi>asking</hi> then he hath in <hi>giving,</hi> that we <hi>leave off petitioning</hi> before he <hi>leave off grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> We are not <hi>ſtraitned in him,</hi> but we are <hi>ſtraitned in our own bowels;</hi> our hearts are not <hi>enlarged</hi> as God would have them, but we give over <hi>firſt,</hi> we are weary <hi>firſt:</hi> God would be willing to hear more of us, but we are willing to leave off, and to ſpeak no more, or elſe God would not be tired out with our requeſts, how many ſoever they be that we put up to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee how abundantly he will ſatisfie us in a <hi>ſtate of glory,</hi> that is ſo willing to fulfill our deſires here, that we leave off ſuing before he leave off granting. There will be <hi>all ſatisfaction</hi> there: if he have more to give <hi>here</hi> then <hi>we ask,</hi> then ſurely when he gets us <hi>there,</hi> we ſhall have our <hi>fill of him,</hi> the deſires of our hearts ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied; if he <hi>ſtream out</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our deſires, what <hi>Rivers will flow</hi> in upon us there? if here he be <hi>above our deſires,</hi> and hath more to give then we to ask; Oh how will the <hi>Sea</hi> break in upon us, to overflow all the banks and bounds of our deſires? there will be a <hi>ſpring-tide</hi> coming in amain upon us; there's that there that will be <hi>good meaſure, preſſed down,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:136185:147"/>ſhaken together, and running over.</hi> If God hath more to give then we ask here; Oh what <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſprings</hi> and <hi>full Seas</hi> of ſatisfaction ſhall we there ſwim in, and like the <hi>Leviathan, play and ſport in it</hi> to all eternity! Our deſires are <hi>ſtrait</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> here, but there as they are <hi>enlarged</hi> more abundantly, ſo they ſhall be abundantly <hi>filled,</hi> and every corner of them brim-full, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.15. and therefore what <hi>longings</hi> and <hi>breathings</hi> ſhould we have after Heaven? Our hearts are <hi>ſtrait</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> here, but there they ſhall be <hi>large,</hi> and be in a capacity to take in more then ever we could here. We ask a <hi>little</hi> here, and ceaſe; but there we ſhall receive in more then ever we <hi>asked</hi> or <hi>thought,</hi> Eph. 3.20. We petition for <hi>a few things,</hi> and then give over; but then when we are in a ſtate of glory, our Souls will be capable of taking in more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly then ever they could let out in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that if we have no more then <hi>we have,</hi> we cannot faſten any blame upon God, he is clear, <hi>The King and his Throne are guiltleſs;</hi> the fault is <hi>ours,</hi> that we <hi>leave off asking,</hi> before he <hi>leave off granting.</hi> We might <hi>have more,</hi> if we <hi>asked more;</hi> our deſires are <hi>ſhort,</hi> when the Lords hand is <hi>long;</hi> our Petitions are at <hi>an end,</hi> when his grants <hi>end not;</hi> we give over <hi>ſpeaking</hi> in prayer, before he hath done <hi>anſwering:</hi> even
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:136185:148"/>the beſt of men have ſooner done in their ſuits, then the Lord hath in his royal gratuities: did we ſtretch out our deſires more, we ſhould finde his loving kindneſs more ſtretched out to us, and further put forth in the extent and latitude of it.</p>

If Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers leave off petitioning before he leave off granting, and end their ſuits before he make an end of giving, what will become of thoſe that <hi>never beg</hi> in their ſuits to him? There are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the world that never put up a ſerious requeſt to him; and if they never get any thing of him, what cauſe have they to complain? <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.2.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Believers.</hi> 1. They know <hi>who God is,</hi> and <hi>who themſelves are,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dare not be <hi>over-bold</hi> with him. He is <hi>a great God,</hi> and they <hi>vile duſt and aſhes,</hi> and how ſhould they dare to preſs too much upon him? Mean men dare not be too bold with their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; how then can we that are Believers that are infinitely below the Lord, make too bold with him? <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> was lowly before <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he looked at himſelf, and all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, to be but <hi>dead men,</hi> and therefore thought he had no right to <hi>cry unto the King,</hi> 2 Sam. 19.28. So Believers judge themſelves,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:136185:149"/>and therefore cannot tell how to be <hi>too bold</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are men of <hi>ingenuity</hi> and <hi>modeſty,</hi> for faith ever keeps down the heart, and makes it low, and is oppoſed to <hi>pride,</hi> Hab. 2.4. We ſee it in the <hi>Centurion,</hi> how humble and modeſt he was, and it was his <hi>faith</hi> that made him ſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.7, 8, 9. and therefore dare not be <hi>over-bold</hi> with him. Humble ingenuity dare not ask <hi>too much</hi> of men, much leſs be <hi>too bold</hi> with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. They are ſuch as think themſelves <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt of his mercies,</hi> Gen. 32.10. and therefore cannot tell how to be too bold with him.</p>

So did <hi>Abraham</hi> here, and if we would evidence
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:136185:156"/>we are <hi>his children,</hi> ſo muſt we. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> go hand in hand, lodge in the ſame breaſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, dwell in the ſame heart together; where the <hi>one is,</hi> there is <hi>the other;</hi> that man in whoſe heart <hi>faith is,</hi> is ever <hi>afraid,</hi> and <hi>tender of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing God,</hi> eſpecially then when he makes his <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>greateſt requeſt to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſee what a mercy of God it is to any of us, that we have <hi>hearts ſtricken with fear of diſpleaſing God,</hi> eſpecially when we pray before him, for thereby he evidenceth to us that we are <hi>Believers:</hi> for ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> did, he was tender of <hi>diſpleaſing him</hi> in praying to him, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his <hi>laſt words</hi> that he ſpake in ſuing to him in their behalf that he prayed for. He would not have the Sun ſet in a Cloud at Even.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee that the <hi>diſpleaſure of God</hi> is <hi>that</hi> that is to be <hi>feared</hi> above all other things. Some there are that <hi>fear man,</hi> but there's <hi>a ſnare</hi> in that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. Some there are that are <hi>afraid of Princes,</hi> and what they can do againſt them, but <hi>they are in Gods hand,</hi> Prov. 21.1. and he knows how to be <hi>terrible to them,</hi> Pſal. 76.12. Some are <hi>afraid of Perſecutors,</hi> but they <hi>can but kill the body,</hi> Luke 12.4. Some are <hi>afraid of evil ſpirits,</hi> and the very <hi>ſuppoſal</hi> of the ſight of them makes even <hi>good men afraid</hi> ſometimes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.26. and ſome are in <hi>great fear</hi> where <hi>no fear is,</hi> Pſal. 53.5. But theſe are all <hi>vain fears,</hi> and like
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:136185:157"/>
                     <hi>Bug-bears</hi> to fright children with; but the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God</hi> is <hi>that</hi> that is to be <hi>feared above all things.</hi> So <hi>godly men</hi> have thought, ſo <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> judged, that was ſo <hi>tender</hi> of diſpleaſing him; <hi>Oh let not the Lord be angry,</hi> ſayes he, and then he cared not who elſe were angry.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſee that to <hi>diſpleaſe God</hi> then when men pray to him, is <hi>that</hi> that <hi>is</hi> and <hi>ought to be moſt loathſome to every gracious heart:</hi> Oh! he would not <hi>then</hi> do any ſuch thing willingly for a world: it's a <hi>burthen</hi> to diſpleaſe him <hi>at any time;</hi> but <hi>then to do it,</hi> when they pray, is <hi>that</hi> that is <hi>moſt abhorring</hi> to them; <hi>Oh let not the Lord be angry,</hi> ſayes <hi>Abraham, and I will ſpeak but this once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſee what a <hi>ſad imprecation</hi> that is that we reade of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.7. <hi>Let his prayer become ſin.</hi> For <hi>Prayer-ſins</hi> have great guilt in them, and godly men of all other ſins, wiſh that they may not diſpleaſe the Lord by them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſee what our <hi>duty</hi> is when we come to pray before the Lord, to look to it that our prayers be <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>undefiled</hi> prayers, that God may not finde any thing in them that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to be angry with us for them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From our ſelves. 3. From our other outward occaſions and imployments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He hath enjoyned and appointed to every one that they ſhould be in <hi>ſome Calling,</hi> and that they ſhould <hi>abide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.20, 24. the <hi>greateſt on Earth</hi> are not exempted: The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is to attend to <hi>his great Work,</hi> Rom. 13.6. the <hi>Miniſter</hi> to his, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. and ſo of the reſt. There's none muſt think to live <hi>an idle life</hi> without a Calling; he hath <hi>appointed to every man his work,</hi> Mark 13.34. he is the <hi>great Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> that hath ſet every one his task; he will have us all be <hi>up and doing:</hi> We muſt not any of us think to live and <hi>do nothing,</hi> but to be buſily imployed in our Callings for him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath of old <hi>ſhadowed out</hi> this to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, the <hi>clean beaſts</hi> were not onely to <hi>chew the cud,</hi> but to <hi>divide the hoof,</hi> Levit. 11.3. Now this <hi>dividing the hoof,</hi> holds out our <hi>right dividing</hi> between our <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and that one ſhould not <hi>croſs,</hi> or <hi>interfere with another,</hi> but diligently and carefully to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>duties of both.</hi> Our <hi>general Calling,</hi> and the duties of it, muſt not <hi>juſtle out</hi> our <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:136185:159"/>Calling;</hi> nor our <hi>particular Calling</hi> muſt not <hi>juſtle out</hi> the duties of our <hi>general Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> but we muſt <hi>divide aright</hi> between them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>reproves Idleneſs</hi> in our <hi>particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> as in that Parable <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would have us <hi>diligently employed,</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully buſie</hi> in our Callings that he hath ſet us in.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>abhors Idleneſs,</hi> being one of <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſins, which provoked him to <hi>rain fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> upon them to deſtroy them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. and to ſend them to Hell to <hi>ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is <hi>ever at work himſelf,</hi> he is <hi>alwayes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> working <hi>Creating work, Providential work;</hi> he is <hi>never idle,</hi> but <hi>full of activity,</hi> pure act, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17. and therefore his will ſure is that <hi>we ſhould work.</hi> The Servants muſt not be <hi>idle</hi> when the Maſter is at <hi>work:</hi> So here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He hath put <hi>activity</hi> in the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: The <hi>Angels,</hi> how full of activity are they? and therefore are deſcribed to have <hi>wings to fly with,</hi> Iſa. 6.2. and they <hi>reſt not day nor night,</hi> but are alwayes buſily imployed in Heaven and in Earth, and where-ever their Commiſſion is to do any work for the Lord. The <hi>Sun</hi> never ſtands ſtill, but is <hi>as a Bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a ſtrong man to run a race,</hi> Pſal. 19.5. And the like may be ſaid of the other <hi>Celeſtiall Bodies,</hi> they are in <hi>continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:136185:159"/>and alwayes caſting forth their <hi>influences.</hi> The <hi>Sea</hi> is working conſtantly, <hi>ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and bearing thoſe great burthens of Ships and other Veſſels upon its back, and carrying them hither and thither from one Country to another; and is in motion by producing ſuch innumerable Creatures as are therein, and by <hi>Leviathan</hi> playing therein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.25, 26. The <hi>Earth,</hi> though it ſtand ſtill, yet is it not <hi>idle,</hi> being the Theatre of all the Acts that are done by the ſons of men; and ſpecially becauſe it is the <hi>breeder</hi> and <hi>feeder</hi> of all the <hi>active Creatures</hi> that are upon it, and becauſe it is <hi>unwearied in bearing ſeed,</hi> and <hi>fruits,</hi> and <hi>herbs,</hi> and <hi>graſs,</hi> and <hi>corn, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> are ever working, and bubling up their water. The <hi>Bee</hi> is a buſie and laborious Creature; and ſo is the <hi>Ant,</hi> that <hi>little Creature;</hi> and therefore <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> adviſeth the <hi>ſluggard to go to her, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her wayes, and be wiſe,</hi> Prov. 6.6, 7, 8. I might be large in the proſecution of this, but theſe inſtances may ſuffice to be as ſo many <hi>glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> to ſhew us how <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>active,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious</hi> we ſhould be in our <hi>particular Callings,</hi> and that God would have us buſily working in our ſeveral places and ſtations for him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From our ſelves.</hi> 1. We are ever <hi>beſt</hi> when we are at work; our hearts are never in <hi>better frame</hi> to go to God in duties of our
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:136185:160"/>
                     <hi>general Calling,</hi> then when we have been moſt conſcientially careful in being diligent in our <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling.</hi> We can then go with comfort to pray, when we have been at work; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are we fitter to offer up this <hi>ſpiritual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> then when <hi>ſloth</hi> hath not ſeized upon us in our <hi>particular Callings.</hi> And hence it is that theſe are coupled together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Not ſlothful in buſineſs, fervent in Spirit ſerving the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſhall be pronounced <hi>bleſſed,</hi> if we <hi>be found well-doing when our Lord cometh,</hi> Matth. 24.46. and it is <hi>that</hi> that we would all deſire after, to be partakers of <hi>that bleſſedneſs,</hi> who would not be found ſo at that day?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are not yet <hi>in heaven,</hi> but <hi>on earth,</hi> and therefore muſt attend on our <hi>outward occaſions</hi> and <hi>buſineſſes</hi> that we are called to. When we come in heaven we ſhall <hi>reſt from all our works</hi> here, and be wholly imployed in <hi>ſerving God,</hi> and <hi>praiſing him,</hi> Rev. 22.3, 4. we ſhall do <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical work, Seraphical work;</hi> but while we are here we muſt be <hi>doing in ordinary work:</hi> and it is a <hi>good work,</hi> becauſe <hi>commanded of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We need many things for the <hi>outward man,</hi> which by diligence in our <hi>ordinary Callings,</hi> through the bleſſing of God, are brought in to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4, 22. we get our <hi>daily bread</hi> by the labour of our hearts and hands, <hi>food,</hi> and <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:136185:160"/>and <hi>phyſick,</hi> and all neceſſaries by the Lords mercy are given in to us this way: <hi>The King himſelf is ſerved by the field,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.9. Gods <hi>crowning the year with his goodneſs,</hi> his <hi>ſteps dropping fatneſs,</hi> make our labours ſucceſsful, and bring in all outward bleſſings to us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diligence in our <hi>Callings</hi> is <hi>that</hi> that God approves, and looks for from every one of us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We are commanded to <hi>labour ſix dayes in the week,</hi> Exod. 20.9. except upon <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion;</hi> as upon a <hi>Faſt,</hi> or by <hi>ſickneſs</hi> we be hindred, or by ſome other occaſion that <hi>juſtly exempts</hi> us, and keeps us neceſſarily from it: we may not look at it as a <hi>permiſſion</hi> onely, but as a <hi>ſtrict command,</hi> and that calls upon us to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our buſineſs, and be <hi>doing</hi> in our <hi>particular Callings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We have <hi>Gods example</hi> in the <hi>firſt Creation</hi> ſet before us to follow, he did his work <hi>in ſix dayes,</hi> and then <hi>reſted,</hi> Exod. 20.9. and ſo would by <hi>his example</hi> have us to work, and to trace his ſteps. So that not onely <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> but <hi>Heaven it ſelf</hi> calls upon us to <hi>labour</hi> and work diligently in our <hi>Callings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From our outward occaſions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments:</hi> 1. They are ſuch as that we cannot ſerve God comfortably neither in our <hi>Bodies,</hi> nor in our <hi>Spirits,</hi> except we labour and attend our <hi>particular Callings,</hi> and we are bound to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:136185:161"/>ſerve him and glorifie him in both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. and how ſhall this be, except we follow our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments? Meat will not fall into our mouthes except we <hi>labour;</hi> Clothing will not be rained down from heaven upon us, except we <hi>work for it:</hi> and without theſe we cannot <hi>ſerve God,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>outward</hi> or <hi>inward man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe imployments in our Callings are ſuch as that we cannot <hi>live without them:</hi> Bread is called <hi>The ſtaff of life,</hi> Iſa. 3.1. and Clothing is the <hi>health of life;</hi> and neither of theſe in an ordinary way can be had without <hi>labour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe imployments in our <hi>particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> are ſuch, as that we cannot expect the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Lord</hi> upon us: <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich;</hi> but it is when <hi>the hand is diligent,</hi> Prov. 10.4, 22. otherwiſe there is no bleſſing of <hi>wealth,</hi> or <hi>increaſe</hi> promiſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe imployments in our <hi>particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> do fit us to come to God in <hi>ſpiritual duties,</hi> and fit us for his coming to us either by <hi>death</hi> or <hi>judgement,</hi> Luke 12.42, 43, 44. and this is worth ſomething. It was the ſpeech of a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter (now with God) to one that he found working hard in his Calling, <hi>Let me be found ſo doing when my Lord cometh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe ordinary imployments keep us from <hi>many ſins,</hi> and from <hi>many temptations to ſin,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from <hi>many aſſaults of the Enemy</hi> that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:136185:161"/>
                     <hi>Idleneſs</hi> will expoſe us to: As we ſee in <hi>Davids</hi> example, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. if he had gone forth to war at that time, or had been doing any thing that was <hi>good,</hi> he would not have faln into ſuch <hi>ſnares</hi> and <hi>ſins</hi> as he did, which <hi>idleneſs</hi> expoſed him to. <hi>Satan</hi> and his own <hi>corruption</hi> would not have ſo <hi>prevailed,</hi> as they then did when he gave himſelf to that <hi>floth</hi> that we there reade of. A diligent hand <hi>prevents</hi> the tempters coming, or at leaſt <hi>hinders him</hi> from overcoming. Working in our Calling will either keep the ſnare from being <hi>laid for us,</hi> or keep our feet from being <hi>taken by it:</hi> And have we not cauſe then to be diligent, and faithfully buſie in our Calling?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Theſe labours and imployments preſerve us from <hi>falling into other dangers and evils;</hi> for God hath promiſed that <hi>his Angels ſhall have charge over us, to keep us in our wayes,</hi> Pſal. 91.11. Let a man but <hi>keep himſelf</hi> in his Calling, and Gods Angels ſhall <hi>keep him:</hi> They are <hi>Gods hoſt,</hi> and ſo long as they are about him, <hi>a ſtrong hoſt is about him,</hi> ſo that <hi>neither plague nor ſickneſs, nor any other evil ſhall come near him,</hi> v. 10. he is <hi>ſafely guarded,</hi> that hath <hi>ſuch a military guard about him;</hi> he need not fear any <hi>danger,</hi> that hath theſe <hi>fiery charets</hi> and <hi>horſes round about him,</hi> 2 Kin. 6.

                     <head>Cautions about our Imployments in our particular Callings.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. WE muſt take heed that <hi>love of the World</hi> ſet us not on work to be buſie in our Callings, for that is ſtraitly forbidden, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2.15. and ſuch are not true to God, but are called <hi>Adulterers,</hi> and <hi>Adultereſſes,</hi> and are the <hi>enemies of God,</hi> Jam. 4.4. and the greateſt enemies that are to themſelves; for thereby they plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into <hi>many ſnares and temptations,</hi> and into <hi>many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in perdition and deſtruction,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. If the <hi>love of the world</hi> be the great wheel that ſets all a going, and puts our hands to labour in our Callings, we ſhall never pleaſe God, nor benefit our ſelves or others by what we do this way. The <hi>World</hi> is both <hi>an Harlot</hi> and <hi>a Witch;</hi> and if we luſt after the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this <hi>Harlot,</hi> and ſuffer our ſelves to be taken with her <hi>eye-lids;</hi> if we ſeek after this <hi>Witch,</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> did after the <hi>Witch of Endor,</hi> and bribe the Harlot and Witch with the <hi>labour of our hands,</hi> we ſhall never do <hi>that</hi> that is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, nor <hi>that</hi> that we ſhall reap any good by, but <hi>pierce our ſelves thorow with many ſorrows,</hi> and when we come to die, we ſhall ſay that <hi>we have laboured for the wind,</hi> and have miſerably deluded our Souls by courting ſuch a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> and enquiring after ſuch an <hi>old Witch,</hi> and taking ſo much pains to <hi>win the World, and loſe our own Souls:</hi> and what a miſerable bargain will that be to us? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt beware that we do not ſo labour in our particular Calling, as that we <hi>reſerve no time for God,</hi> and for <hi>holy duties.</hi> Many there are that are ſo intent upon their ordinary imployment, that God hears not of them neither in their Cloſets, nor in their Families, and it may be ſcarce come to Publick Worſhip; or if to <hi>any of theſe,</hi> or <hi>all of theſe,</hi> yet they are ſo indiſpoſed, ſo drowſie, ſo careleſs, and every way ſo unfit, that they had better do nothing. Some labour in their particular Calling all the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:136185:162"/>week ſo, that on the Lords-day they are fitter to <hi>ſleep</hi> then to <hi>pray,</hi> to take <hi>a Nap of an hour long,</hi> then to <hi>bear half ſo long;</hi> or if they keep their eyes open, yet their hearts are aſleep, or going after their Covetouſneſs, and both eyes and heart are eſtranged from <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Duty,</hi> and the <hi>Day,</hi> and are ſo common and unſavoury, that God abhors what they offer up to him, being no better then <hi>blinde, and lame, and ſick ſacrifices,</hi> which they would be loth to preſent a Prince with, but they think any thing good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for God. Let ſuch know, that <hi>the Curſe is not farre from ſuch men.</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>Malac.</hi> 1.8, 14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We muſt take need that in labouring in our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Calling, we do not ſpend our labour for that <hi>which ſatisfieth not, Iſa.</hi> 55.2. The truth is, theſe outward things that men labour for, will not ſatisfie, they are not Bread that is of a filling nature. Hence <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.19. and therefore ſuch labour turns to no profit: To <hi>eat, and not have enough by our labour; to earn wages, and put all in a bag with holes,</hi> is a judgement, <hi>Haggai</hi> 1.6.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We muſt beware that we ſuppoſe not that <hi>Gain is Godlineſs,</hi> for that were a ſtrange ſuppoſition; yet the holy Ghoſt tells us ſome ſuch there are, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. We muſt not have ſuch a ſuppoſition, nor go upon ſuch a principle in labouring in our particular Calling. There are multitudes that labour for no other end but to get the Wealth of the world, as if that were the only thing that they were to minde; and that it is <hi>godlineſs enough,</hi> if they can but <hi>gain enough.</hi> But this is that which is a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome conceit, and ſavours of a baſe and ſordid ſpirit, and comes from the earth, and will lead men to perdition and deſtruction: And the Apoſtle tells us that <hi>Godlineſs is great gain,</hi> in oppoſition to that ſuppoſition.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We muſt take heed that in labouring in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings we do not <hi>labour for our ſelves onely,</hi> but to do good with what we get by our labour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. Some there are that are <hi>wholly for themſelves,</hi> and ſo they may but
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:136185:163"/>pocket up for themſelves, and fill their own Coffers, they never regard the helping and ſuccouring of others: but God would have us to attend our particular Callings, and to labour in them ſo, that we may do good to others, eſpecially to thoſe that ſtand in need of our help. Chriſt himſelf tells us this, that <hi>the poor we have alwayes with us,</hi> and when we will we may do them good, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.7. intimating, that we are not to be all for our ſelves, but to do good to others that need. And ſo <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.10. was <hi>forward to remember the poor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. We muſt beware that in labouring in our Callings we ſpend not what we ſo get <hi>in rioting and drunkenneſs,</hi> and upon our luſts. Many ſuch there are, that get a great deal by labour in their Calling, but ſpend it all waſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and prodigally, and conſume it upon their luſts; and ſometimes that they have got in a week or fortnight, they ſpend riotonſly in one day, or in one piece of day. We muſt take heed of this labour in our Calling, and what we get by a diligent hand, muſt be better laid out then upon our luſts, elſe we had as good have ſate ſtill, and done nothing.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. We muſt take heed that in labouring in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings we forget not <hi>what we ſhould chiefly labour for,</hi> Joh. 6.27. we muſt not ſo much labour for <hi>periſhing meat,</hi> but for that <hi>that endureth to everlaſting life.</hi> So <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. theſe things are worth the labouring for. Other things that we labour about will not profit us when we die, nor <hi>in the day of wrath,</hi> Prov. 11.4. but if we labour for <hi>theſe things</hi> that we are above all other things to attend unto, then we may have comfort in our other labour; and when we come to our reſt in the dark night of death, we ſhall finde that our reſt ſhall be ſweet, and we ſhall reap the fruit of labour, and rejoyce that <hi>we have not laboured in vain.</hi>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee that there is no footing in Scripture for that Hereſie of the <hi>Enchites,</hi> that pretended to do nothing elſe but to <hi>Pray,</hi> and to make that their <hi>onely calling;</hi> for God not onely <hi>allows</hi> us, but <hi>looks</hi> for it from every one of us, that we ſhould be buſied in our particular Calling, and faithfully diſcharge the duties that God requires in that, as well as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our general Calling in the ſeaſon of it. It is his will that we ſhould <hi>attend both,</hi> and that one ſhould not <hi>thruſt out</hi> another, but God have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from us in the due and faithful execution of the Lords will in both, that we may divide aright between the one and the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſee that <hi>idle perſons that will not work at all,</hi> but ſpend their time in <hi>gaming,</hi> and <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> and <hi>ſleeping,</hi> and in <hi>tatling,</hi> and <hi>medling</hi> with others, and are <hi>buſie-bodies,</hi> are <hi>loathſome to God,</hi> and bring diſhonour to the Goſpel, and the Religion that they profeſs: for God looks for it from every one of us, that as we are to minde our general Calling, ſo we are to go about our particular Calling, and not to be wanting in the faithful diſcharge of the duties of it. We know what <hi>miſchief</hi> that <hi>abundance of Idleneſs</hi> that was in <hi>Sodom</hi> brought upon them, it filled them full of <hi>fiery luſts,</hi> that caſt them into <hi>the fire of hell, Jude</hi> ven. 7. Idle perſons that will not work with their hands, will be <hi>buſie</hi> ſome other way; their
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:136185:164"/>
                        <hi>tongues will go,</hi> though their <hi>hands ſtir not,</hi> and they will be <hi>tatlers,</hi> if they be not <hi>workers,</hi> and do evil with their <hi>lips,</hi> though they move neither <hi>hand</hi> nor <hi>foot</hi> in the works that God calls them to labour in, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13. Idle perſons are not <hi>idle in doing miſchief,</hi> but are buſie in doing the Devils work: but we muſt do Gods work, and not the Devils, except we would have <hi>the Devils wages,</hi> rather then that <hi>bleſſed reward</hi> that God for Chriſts ſake beſtows upon us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſee that <hi>diligence</hi> in our particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is <hi>that</hi> that God is well pleaſed with (taking in the <hi>Cautions</hi> before ſpoken of) Let <hi>Prayan</hi> uſher in <hi>labour,</hi> and labour with be very <hi>acceptable to God. Abraham</hi> may <hi>go to his place,</hi> and do what he hath to do, when he hath been with God in Prayer. It's <hi>bleſſed work</hi> that we go about, when Prayer hath <hi>begun the work;</hi> the <hi>more we labour</hi> then, the <hi>more ſmiles</hi> we have upon our labour from the God of heaven, and when <hi>our Lord comes,</hi> it will be <hi>happy for us to be found ſo doing:</hi> yea, if from obedience to God we are <hi>working faithfully,</hi> we may with as much comfort die at that time, as if we had been performing ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our general Calling. <hi>Pray</hi> and work, <hi>hear</hi> and work, <hi>meditate in the Word</hi> and work; do all ſo in the duties of our general Calling, as that the duties of our particular Calling may be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended to. <hi>Calvin</hi> when full of <hi>bodily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi>
                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:136185:164"/>and <hi>pains,</hi> would not intermit his <hi>labours</hi> becauſe he would not be <hi>found idle when his Lord ſhould come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. We ſee what cauſe we have to be <hi>thankeful</hi> that God allows us and looks for it from us, that we ſhould <hi>labor in our particular Calling,</hi> whereby we may get thoſe things that are <hi>needful for the body;</hi> for we cannot <hi>want theſe things</hi> for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. God is tender of our <hi>families,</hi> &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our <hi>outward man,</hi> &amp; would have us labour for that end; and it is his mercy that he allows us to go about our <hi>ordinary imployment,</hi> that we may have our <hi>neceſſary food,</hi> and things convenient for the body. Our <hi>bodies,</hi> as they are part of <hi>Chriſts Purchaſe,</hi> are <hi>dear to him,</hi> and he would not have them want any thing that's <hi>needful for them,</hi> that we may with <hi>comfort</hi> ſerve him in our pilgrimage here: and though they be but <hi>cottages of clay,</hi> yet he would have them upholden; though they be but the <hi>ſheaths of our Souls,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> calls them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.15. yet he would not have this <hi>ſheath</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or mangled, but kept in its <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and that it may be ſo, he appoints us to <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> that what may tend to the preſervation of it may be <hi>brought in,</hi> that the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>it,</hi> while they are <hi>joyned together,</hi> may glorifie God the more chearfully, till death make a <hi>divorce betwixt them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. We ſee that they that <hi>abide not in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> but <hi>ſtep out of it,</hi> are not <hi>ſafe,</hi> but as <hi>Solomon</hi>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:136185:165"/>ſayes, are in danger to be made a prey of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.8. <hi>As a bird that wandreth from her neſt, ſo is the man that wandreth from his place.</hi> A mans <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> is his <hi>neſt,</hi> which while he keeps in, he is ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protected in by God and his holy Angels, but when he <hi>wanders from it,</hi> Satan that ſubtile <hi>fowler</hi> will ſhoot at him, and make a prey of him.

                  <p>Q. 1. <hi>How does it appear that our Prayer is a communing with God, and that his Anſwers are a communing with us?</hi> Let me ſpeak to the <hi>firſt</hi> firſt, <hi>That our Prayer is a communing with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. In that when we pray, we <hi>draw near to God;</hi> they that commune together, <hi>draw near</hi> firſt one to another: So <hi>Abraham drew near to God</hi> in Prayer, and ſo <hi>communed with God. [But of that I have fully ſpoken in the firſt Note.]</hi>
                  </p>

We could not be <hi>familiar</hi> with God; nor he with us, except we come to <hi>a reconciled God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that when we pray we <hi>walk with God:</hi> ſo <hi>Enoch,</hi> Gen. 5.22, 24. Prayer was <hi>one path</hi> that he <hi>walked with God</hi> in. Now they that walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, do familiarly commune one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo it is between God and us.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. In that when we pray to God we <hi>plead with him,</hi> and that holds out our communing with him. They that <hi>plead at the Barre</hi> before a Judge, commune with him: ſo they that plead with God. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 16.21. <hi>O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his nightbour:</hi> and 23.3, 4. <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him, that I might come even to his ſeat!

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. In that when he grants our requeſts he <hi>liſtens to what we ſay</hi> when we pray, and <hi>anſwers us,</hi> and ſo <hi>commines with us;</hi> ſo does one man to another, and ſo does God to us.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. In that when he grants our requeſts he is
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:136185:167"/>
                     <hi>pleaſed with us,</hi> as they are that commune loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together one with another. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In that when he grants our requeſts he <hi>loves our company</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> and gives us a pledge of it hereby, as they do that <hi>commune</hi> one with another.

                  <p n="6">6.

Princes will not grant their Petitions whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not in favour with them; but when they are accepted, and in favour, they may have any thing: So here.</p>
                  <p>Q. 2. <hi>What manner of communing is it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is a <hi>ſerious communing;</hi> we are ſerious with God when we pray to him, and do not trifle with him: and he is ſerious with us when he grants us what we ſue unto him for, he does not <hi>word it</hi> with us but is very <hi>real</hi> with us, and ſayes no more then he will certainly do for us: he <hi>will fulfil with his hand, what he ſpeaks with his mouth,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.24. Even <hi>Balaam</hi> (when guided by a better Spirit then his own) could ſay, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19 <hi>God is not a man that he ſhould lie, neither the ſon of man that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaid, and ſhall
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:136185:167"/>he not do it? or hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> Men may ſay <hi>in word,</hi> and unſay what they have ſaid <hi>in their deed,</hi> (ſo trifling, and vain, and falſe they are) but it is not ſo with God, he is <hi>ſerious</hi> in what he ſayes, and will make good all he ſayes in <hi>a promiſing way</hi> to us. If a Kings grant be given out, it is for his honour to ſee it performed, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.12. <hi>I Darius have made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, let it be done with ſpeed:</hi> how much more will the Lord be ſerious with us when he gives out any grants to us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>comfortable communing;</hi> when we pray we ſweetly converſe with him: <hi>ſweet is thy voice,</hi> Cant. 2.14. and when he grants our requeſts he ſweetly converſeth with us. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there any ſweetneſs between the deareſt relations, like <hi>that</hi> that is between the Lord and us, when we pray to him, and he grants our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts that we put up to him. There is much ſweetneſs between <hi>husband</hi> and <hi>wife,</hi> between <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>childe</hi> in their communing together; but no ſweetneſs like to <hi>that</hi> that is betwixt the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>us</hi> when we pray to him, and he grants our requeſts to us: Our prayers are <hi>ſweet Odours,</hi> Rev. 5.8. and his grants are ſo many <hi>ſweet ſmiles</hi> of his face, and ſo many <hi>ſweet kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> and ſo many <hi>amiable and ſweet glances</hi> and <hi>caſts of his eye towards us,</hi> or ſo many <hi>ſweet words of his mouth,</hi> that like <hi>ſweet wine chear our hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:136185:168"/>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an <hi>holy communing:</hi> if ever we be <hi>holy,</hi> it is ſo with us when we pray to the Lord, we lift up <hi>holy hands to him,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. and <hi>holy hearts,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.8. <hi>holineſs becomes us at all times,</hi> but then more eſpecially when we pray to the holy One: and when the Lord grants our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts (as he is alwayes holy, ſo) he remembers his <hi>holy promiſe</hi> to us, and that <hi>holy Covenant</hi> that he hath made with us, and ſo our mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning is an holy communing. When two gratious ones are ſpeaking and communing together, Oh what holy breathings are there ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered forth between them, their ſpeeches are ſeaſoned with holineſs, and argue holy hearts: but when God and we commune together, there is no holineſs like <hi>that,</hi> an holy God and an holy Soul breathe out much holineſs in communing one with another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a <hi>friendly communing;</hi> we are <hi>friends to God</hi> (if believers,) <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23. and when we pray in faith we friendly commune with him, and God is a friend to us: and when he grants our requeſts, he does like a friend to us, and in a friendly manner does commune with us. There is no friendſhip on earth, in all the communings that are between men and men, comparable to that friendly communing that is between God and us when we pray to him, and when he grants our deſires to us. Great hath been that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:136185:168"/>that hath been between ſome men, as both <hi>ſacred and heathen ſtories</hi> tell us, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munings together have been very friendly: <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were very friendly, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.41. So <hi>Heathen Authors</hi> tell us of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pithias,</hi> of <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes,</hi> that have been great friends, and been full of love one to another; but no friendſhip like to <hi>that</hi> that is between the Lord and the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul; no friendly communings like theirs, when the ſoul is in a praying frame, and when the Lord grants the deſires of ſuch a ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is an <hi>humble communing;</hi> when we pray, we <hi>humble</hi> and lay our ſelves <hi>low</hi> before God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did that looked at himſelf as <hi>vile duſt and aſhes:</hi> humility does alwayes become us, but never more then when we pray to the high God: we never behave our ſelves ſo humbly as when we ſpeak to ſuch a Prince as he is, and when God grants our requeſts he <hi>humbleth himſelf</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to look at ſuch vile worms as we are, and to have reſpect to the petitions that we put up to him. God <hi>humbleth himſelf</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the things that are <hi>done in Heaven,</hi> when he looks at what the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>bleſſed Souls</hi> do for him, in praiſing and yielding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him: but when he beholds what is done <hi>upon Earth,</hi> by ſuch as we are, and accepts our prayers, and grants us what we petition for;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:136185:169"/>Oh how low does he ſtoop, and how does he <hi>humble himſelf,</hi> that we may commune with him, and he vouchſafes thus to commune with us, and to be ſo familiar with us, we may well ſay, <hi>Who is a God like our God? Pſal.</hi> 113.5, 6. to be ſure what ever our failings be, and how ſhort ſoever we fall of humbling our ſelves before him, he exceedingly humbleth himſelf, and condeſcends and comes very low to us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a <hi>gracious communing;</hi> when we pray we utter gracious words; grace is in <hi>our lips,</hi> and grace bubbles from the fountain of <hi>our hearts:</hi> as we <hi>ſing with grace in our hearts, Col.</hi> 3.16. ſo when we pray, we pray <hi>with grace from our hearts,</hi> and hence it is that theſe two are coupled together, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>a ſpirit of grace and of ſupplication.</hi> The ſame ſpirit that is a ſpirit of <hi>ſupplication,</hi> is a ſpirit of <hi>grace</hi> in us. But when the Lord hears us, and grants our requeſts, and that way communes with us; Oh how gracious is he to us! <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.27. There are gracious communings between man and man ſometimes, ſo as that they are in heaven together upon earth; but there are no ſuch gracious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munings as is between the Lord and us, when we pray and he grants.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is a <hi>glorious communing.</hi> Oh <hi>the divine luſtre</hi> that is in our faces ſometimes when we have been at Prayer! Oh the <hi>glorious beauty</hi> that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:136185:169"/>is then ſeen in our very countenances! look as it was with Chriſt himſelf, ſo it was with us: it is ſaid of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.29. <hi>as he prayed, the faſhion of his countenance was altered;</hi> there was great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeen upon it; ſo it is with us ſometimes when we pray there is a kind of <hi>heavenly glory</hi> ſparkles in our faces, and when he grants our requeſts, and commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s that way with us, Oh how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is he in his grace and mercy to us! how gloriouſly does he diſpenſe himſelf to us? it is a glorious communing: he glorifies himſelf, and puts glory upon us thereby.</p>
                  <p>Q. 3. <hi>Why will God be ſo familiar with us, and ſuffer us to be ſo familiar with him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. and they that are moſt loving, will be moſt familiar with them that they love. Now God being <hi>originally, primarily, eminently, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, eſſentially, everlaſtingly love</hi> to his believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones; hence it is that he is ſo familiar with them, as to commune in ſo friendly a way with them. Love is ever the <hi>efficient procreant and conſerving cauſe</hi> of familiarity between man and man, and Gods love is <hi>that</hi> that makes him ſo familiar as to commune with us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>abundant in goodneſs,</hi> Exod. 34.6. and the more a man abounds in goodneſs, the more familiar he will be to thoſe that are dear to him, he will commune with them, and make himſelf
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:136185:170"/>very familiar with them: and ſo it is with the Lord, his <hi>abundant goodneſs</hi> makes him have ſweet familiarity, ſo as to commune with us, though we be ſinful <hi>duſt and aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is ſuch an one as <hi>humbleth himſelf</hi> in an <hi>unparallel'd way,</hi> Pſal. 113.5, 6. and humble ones are very familiar with thoſe they delight in. Proud perſons ſcorn to be familiar with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, but humble ones will come low this way, they will take their inferiours by the hand, and talk &amp; commune familiarly with them; how much more will God do it, who does ſo humble himſelf that none may be <hi>compared to him therein?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is a <hi>Father in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> to us, and therefore will be familiar with us: Fathers are familiar with their children, will <hi>ſpeak</hi> familiarly, and <hi>commune</hi> with them, and <hi>grant</hi> their deſires; ſo will the Lord familiarly commune with us, and grant us our deſires that we ask of him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14, 15. there's no father on earth that will be ſo familiar with his children, as he will be with us, though there be ſuch an infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is <hi>an Husband to us,</hi> Iſa. 54.5. and there's <hi>no greater familiarity</hi> in the world then is <hi>between husband</hi> &amp; <hi>wife;</hi> how much more then <hi>between the Lord</hi> and <hi>us?</hi> he will vouchſafe to commune with us <hi>in giving in</hi> all we deſire of him. <hi>Eſthers</hi> huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand which was a great <hi>Monarch,</hi> ſo ſweetly &amp;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:136185:170"/>familiarly converſed with her, that ſhee might have any thing that ſhee deſired of him, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.3 and what then may not we expect from the Lord, that doth more familiarly commune thus with us then any husband in the world that is moſt dear to his ſpouſe?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is <hi>our friend,</hi> Cant. 5.19. and therefore is ſo ſweetly familiar with us. A friend will be very familiar, ſo will the Lord be, and give us all we ſue unto him for; Friendſhip carries famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity ever along with it. A friend is as dear as a mans own ſoul, and lies next the ſoul, and will be familiar whoever is not; ſuch a friend is the Lord, he will be familiar with us, and though he will be reſerved to others, and carry himſelf as a ſtranger to them, yet he will be very familiar with his own.</p>
                  <p>But in the ſecond place, <hi>Why will he ſuffer us to be ſo familiar with him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We are thoſe that are a people <hi>near to him,</hi> Pſal. 148.14. and though ſometimes we were <hi>far off,</hi> are made <hi>nigh</hi> by the blood of Chriſt <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. and will he not ſuffer us that are ſo <hi>nigh him</hi> to be familiar with him? he will ſurely let us commune in a familiar and friendly way with him. They that are near the King, as <hi>they of the Council</hi> and <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> be, they may ſpeak familiarly to him and bring <hi>their Petitions</hi> before him: ſo may we that are <hi>ſo nigh to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:136185:171"/>
                  <p n="2">2. We that are believers are they that finde favour in his eyes, and to whom he holds out the <hi>golden ſcepter</hi> of <hi>his grace,</hi> as that Kingd did to <hi>Eſther,</hi> Eſth. 5.2. and therefore may draw near, and touch the top of <hi>the Scepter as ſhe did,</hi> and make our Petitions boldly and familiarly to him. They that are in favour with <hi>a Prince</hi> may be familiar <hi>with him,</hi> and He of his Princely grace will ſuffer them ſo to be: how much more may we that are <hi>in favour</hi> with God, who is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> above all the gracious Princes in the earth for <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are they that he will admit to greateſt and ſweeteſt familiarity in <hi>another world,</hi> that he will lay us in his <hi>everlaſting arms,</hi> and put us in his <hi>boſome;</hi> no familiarity will be like that, when we ſhall be ever with the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. and ſee his face, and be transformed into his <hi>image,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. Now God would give us a pledge of that then by ſuffering us to be familiar with him now. <hi>[But of this I ſhall ſpeak more when I come to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are <hi>united to him</hi> by the Spirit <hi>through Faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> ever takes in <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Familiarity</hi> with it. It is ſo in all the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions</hi> that we can name in the world, and ſo it is in this <hi>Myſtical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lord and us; we have ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and moſt familiar acquaintance and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:136185:171"/>with him by being ſo united to him: they that are one fleſh, as man and wife are, are familiar one with another, how much more then are they that are joyned to the Lord, <hi>and ſo are one ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We are his <hi>choſen ones</hi> that he delighted in from all eternity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. and they that he hath ſet his <hi>Electing love upon,</hi> he will ſuffer to be familiar with him; they that are our <hi>choiſe ones</hi> that we have ſet our hearts upon, we are willing that they ſhould be familiar with us, and that in a <hi>friendly way</hi> they ſhould commune with us: now ſuch are we to God, and therefore he will ſuffer us to be familiar with him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are they that <hi>he challengeth</hi> a <hi>propriety in,</hi> Iſa. 43.1. <hi>Thou art mine:</hi> we are his every way, by right of <hi>Creation,</hi> by right of <hi>Redemption,</hi> by right of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over us, by right of <hi>Power</hi> over us, as the <hi>Potter</hi> hath over his clay, by right of <hi>Eſpouſage</hi> of us to himſelf: name any <hi>right</hi> that we can, he hath true title to us and intereſt in us, and ſo reciprocally have we in him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.3. <hi>I am my beloveds and he is mine:</hi> now he being <hi>ours</hi> and we <hi>his</hi> all theſe wayes, what marvel is it if he ſuffer us to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and to commune with him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We ſee the great condeſcendency of the great God; that he will
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:136185:172"/>ſtoop ſo low as to commune with <hi>duſt and aſhes,</hi> and to ſuffer us to be familiar with him, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning and ſpeaking in prayer to him. Oh the infinite diſtance that is betwixt the Lord and us? we are not able to conceive it, much leſs to expreſs it: what's a drop of a <hi>Bucket</hi> to the great <hi>Ocean?</hi> what's a <hi>Candle</hi> to the <hi>Sun?</hi> what's a ſmall <hi>duſt of the ballance</hi> to the whole <hi>Earth?</hi> what's a <hi>little ſpark</hi> to a great <hi>flaming Fire?</hi> what's <hi>nothing</hi> and leſs then <hi>nothing,</hi> to him that is <hi>all,</hi> and in <hi>all,</hi> and infinitely above all <hi>created Beings?</hi> theſe are ſome Scripture reſemblances to ſet forth, and ſhadow out the <hi>infinite diſtance</hi> that is between the great God and all nations, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. that therefore this infinite one ſhould vouchſafe to be familiar with us, and to commune with us, and to ſuffer us to be ſo familiar with him, as to ſpeak in Prayer <hi>to him</hi> and commune <hi>with him,</hi> it is great condeſcendency in him, and <hi>that</hi> that we may well wonder at, that he ſhould ſo humble himſelf, whence is this to us? what can we ſay in way of admiring at it? our words and our thoughts muſt needs be all ſwallowed up in <hi>conſideration of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee what an holy <hi>bluſh</hi> this may put into our faces, that we are ſo little familiar with him in praying to him, but keep <hi>far from him</hi> too often, when we have leave and liberty to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with him:</hi> there are too many that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:136185:172"/>prayer before God, <hi>Job</hi> 15.4. and when he would admit them into his acquaintance, and let them be familiar with him, they have to do <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> about <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> outward occaſions, <hi>and ſo men let go the beſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſweet familiarity with the bleſſed God.</hi> Might a man be admitted to be familiar with a Prince, would he not accept it with all <hi>humble gratitude,</hi> would he decline it? Oh how unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily do we then carry it to the great God, that when we may familiarly commune with the Lord, we decline his company, and minde other matters which are not worth <hi>a ſtraw under our feet</hi> in compariſon of this <hi>ſweet colloquy</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning</hi> with the Lord our God?</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

If God ſtoops low, it is not for vain man to lift up himſelf or look high. Will he commune with us, and let us commune with him? we may well then ſloop to commune
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:136185:173"/>with thoſe that are ſome way <hi>lower</hi> then we are.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:136185:174"/>Then, then our familiarity will be increaſed with him, and his with us: friends by being long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether here finde their friendſhip and familiarity to grow; husband and wife that have been in that relation many years, how is their ſweet famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity angmented and raiſed up to the higheſt pitch: the like I might ſay of other friends.

Some ſick perſons may be left <hi>alone,</hi> and none may come at them, to miniſter any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to their ſouls, or to ſpeak <hi>a word in ſeaſon</hi> to them; but then they may have liberty to ſpeak to the Lord, and to commune with him, and he will ſpeak to them; and there's no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning

Some are <hi>ſhut up in their ſpirits,</hi> as <hi>Heman</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.8. and <hi>cannot get forth;</hi> but the Lord can give them ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as to ſpeak and commune in <hi>prayer</hi> with him, as <hi>he did;</hi> and God himſelf communes with them, as he did with him.

As Chriſt ſayes to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>You ſhall all be ſcattered and leave me, yet I am not alone, becauſe the Father is with me,</hi> Joh. 16.32. So it is with us, when all are ſcattered from us, and we left alone, yet we are not alone, but the Lord is with us: we cannot have a word
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:136185:178"/>from <hi>men,</hi> but we may ſpeak many to <hi>the Lord.</hi> As it is ſaid of that Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, <hi>That he ſpake more words to God then he did to men.</hi> He was a devout man indeed, in his way of a Papiſt, but whether the report be true or no, I leave that, <hi>ſit fides penes authorem:</hi> onely I may make this uſe of it, That there are ſome in the world that are ſo <hi>familiar with God,</hi> that they do indeed ſpeak more words to <hi>Him</hi> then they do to <hi>men,</hi> and they may have comfort in it.</p>

                     <head>Poſitive comforts from hence.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. IF when we <hi>pray,</hi> and the Lord <hi>grant</hi> our deſires, we commune with him, and he with us, we are <hi>very familiar with him, and he with us;</hi> then ſurely Believers are in <hi>higheſt eſteem</hi> with the Lord; for the greateſt men upon earth if they be not ſuch, cannot have this priviledge granted to them. Kings have their <hi>prerogatives,</hi> and they ſtand much upon them; but no King on earth, if he walk not in the ſteps of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams faith,</hi> can have this <hi>royal prerogative</hi> to <hi>commune with the Lord,</hi> or to have the Lord to <hi>commune with him,</hi> Pſal. 94.20. this is peculiar to true believers that they may have this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Lord, and the Lord with them, that they may ſweetly commune one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Great is the <hi>eſteem</hi> that ſuch have with the <hi>great God,</hi> that he will vouchſafe to ſpeak with them, and let them be ſo familiar with him, as to ſpeak with him. It's comfort, that though we be thus <hi>low</hi> as we are, yet we are in <hi>high eſteem</hi> with him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it is no matter though ſome men will not ſpeak to us, nor ſuffer us to ſpeak to them, God does <hi>both;</hi> he graciouſly will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with us, and will not diſdain that we ſhould familiarly commune with him: if <hi>duſt</hi>
                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:136185:181"/>and <hi>aſhes</hi> will have no familiarity with their <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-duſt</hi> and <hi>aſhes,</hi> it is well for us that the <hi>great God</hi> does not refuſe to be familiar with us, though we be but (as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtiled himſelf) <hi>duſt and aſhes.</hi> If <hi>man contemn</hi> and <hi>God honour,</hi> what need we care for ſuch contempt? If a <hi>ſhrub</hi> lift up himſelf, and the <hi>higheſt Cedar</hi> ſtoop to ſuch as we are, as it ſhould be marvellous in our eyes, ſo it may well be the joy and rejoice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If God vouchſafe to commune with us, and let us commune with him, then <hi>we begin Heaven upon Earth,</hi> and have a taſte of Heaven before we come there; to <hi>commune</hi> with God, is <hi>Heaven upon Earth:</hi> they live in Heaven that have ſuch familiarity with God, though they be on Earth. And as that gracious man ſaid when he was to dye, <hi>I ſhall change my place, but not my company;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of others that have had much fellowſhip with the Lord, when they dye <hi>they change their place, but not their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> to go from one heaven to another, from <hi>heaven upon earth</hi> in their communing with God here, to <hi>Heaven in another World,</hi> to be with him in glory forever. And is not this ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the Saints, that whereas the greateſt number of men live in <hi>Hell upon Earth,</hi> having fellowſhip with Devils; Believers by being much with God are in a corner of <hi>Heaven upon Earth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:136185:181"/>
                     <p n="4">4. It is great comfort to Believers that the time is <hi>haſting</hi> when (as they have had ſweet communings with the Lord here, ſo) they ſhall enjoy everlaſting communion with him in glory: It is but a little while, and the time will be when <hi>we ſhall be ever with the Lord:</hi> when a few dayes are come, we ſhall have other manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munings with him, and he with us, then now we have. As Dr. <hi>Taylour</hi> ſometimes ſaid, with rejoicing, <hi>within two ſtiles, and I ſhall be at my Fathers houſe;</hi> ſo after a little time we ſhall go to God, where we ſhall be better acquainted with him, and be more familiar with him: that though our communings together be very <hi>ſweet</hi> here, yet ere long we ſhall have <hi>ſweeter</hi> fellowſhip one with another: here we have ſome <hi>ſmiles,</hi> and <hi>kiſſes,</hi> and ſuch communings as put us in Heaven; but within a little time we ſhall have more: after a few weariſome <hi>agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conflicts</hi> with enemies and troubles, we ſhall reſt in his armes, and be alwayes in his preſence, and lye next his heart, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munings we ſhall then have together, we ſhall then know when we come to the happy enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our God, then <hi>all tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes,</hi> all ſorrows removed from our hearts, all burthens taken from our ſhoulders; we ſhall <hi>ſigh no more,</hi> nor <hi>weep no more,</hi> nor <hi>feel pain any more,</hi> nor <hi>ſin any more;</hi> no <hi>Devils</hi> ſhall

                        <hi>tempt us,</hi> no men <hi>enſnare us,</hi> no bad company <hi>weary, diſcontent, afflict us,</hi> no perſecuters <hi>hunt us, entangle us, entrap us,</hi> go about to <hi>ruine us:</hi> but we ſhall be with God, and he with us; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune of <hi>high things,</hi> and what we could not know in our <hi>child-hood,</hi> we ſhall have revealed to us when we <hi>become men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10, 11, 12. To end in a word or two more; after we have been toſſed with <hi>tempeſt</hi> a little while, we ſhall come to the <hi>Haven;</hi> after we have been in the <hi>battel</hi> we ſhall gain the <hi>victory;</hi> after we have <hi>wreſtled,</hi> we ſhall win and wear the <hi>Crown;</hi> and after a few <hi>embraces</hi> in the arms of God here, in our fellowſhip that we have with him in this world, we ſhall be <hi>claſped</hi> in his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting arms, and be <hi>kiſſed</hi> and <hi>embraced</hi> by him to all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall we come to know that this happy condition ſhall be ours?</hi>

By our <hi>Holineſs,</hi> Matth. 5.8. 1 John 3.2, 3. <hi>Holy</hi> here, <hi>Happy</hi> hereafter: <hi>Without Holineſs we ſhall never ſee God,</hi> Hebr. 12.14. but if we be <hi>holy</hi> in body and ſpirit, we ſhall ſee him with comfort; and have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fellowſhip with him. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the <hi>Beauty of Heaven,</hi> for they are <hi>all holy</hi> there; and none that are <hi>defiled</hi> come into the <hi>holy
